Full Episode Monday, Feb 2\nthat Trump's senior adviser Hope Hicks had tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday. Shortly after, it was announced that the president and first lady had been tested and were awaiting results. Trump revealed in a tweet just before 1 a.m. that they both had tested positive. \"Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19,\" Trump tweeted. \"We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!\" In a memo shortly after Trump's tweet, Dr. Conley wrote, \"The President and First Lady are both well at this time, and they plan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence.\" Trump's Friday schedule, which was set to include a trip to a campaign rally in Florida, was cleared except for one phone call to discuss \"COVID-19 support to vulnerable seniors.\" How could COVID-19 potentially affect Trump? Trump is 74 years old, which puts him at higher risk of experiencing more severe COVID-19 symptoms. People between the ages of 65 and 74 are nearly five times more likely to be hospitalized for COVID-19 related complications than those between ages 18 and 29, according to June data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People 75 to 84 years old are about 7 times more likely to be hospitalized than the 18 to 29 age group. \"There's no evidence that [Trump] is seeing or experiencing any conflicts or any particular serious symptoms as of right now,\" Alcindor said to Brangham. \"But I want to reiterate that we're talking about a senior citizen, and someone who falls in the group of people that Dr. [Anthony] Fauci and so many other health officials have said have to be extra vigilant when it comes to this virus.\" Gary Simon, a medical doctor and director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at George Washington University, told the PBS NewsHour that it's unclear at this point how the virus will affect Trump's heath. \"It's very hard to predict simply based on the epidemiology, how he's going to do. Certainly he's going to do worse than somebody with the same symptoms who's 25 years old,\" Simon said. \"But the markers that predict disease are mostly laboratory markers, and we don't know any of those.\" Throughout his first term the White House has been vague regarding the details of Trump's health.

Watch the conversation in the video player above. The president and his wife are both displaying symptoms, though White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said they are mild. In a memo Friday afternoon, White House physician Sean Conley said Trump received a single 8-gram dose of Regeneron's polyclonal antibody cocktail as treatment, adding that the president \"remains fatigued but in good spirits.\" The White House released a statement on Friday-- less than 24 hours after his positive test was announced-- that the president was being moved to Walter Reed hospital. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said that Trump \"remains in good spirits\" but will be moved to Walter Reed and working from there for the coming days \"out of an abundance of caution, and at the recommendation of his physician and medical experts.\" The news of Trump's diagnosis sparked a flurry of questions over the future of Trump's campaign, the dozens of people he's had contact with in recent days, as well as how the illness will affect his presidential duties. PBS NewsHour's William Brangham and Yamiche Alcindor answered questions from viewers about Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis and what this means for the 2020 election. How did the news of Trump's diagnosis unfold? Bloomberg News first reported on Thursday night that Trump's senior adviser Hope Hicks had tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday. Shortly after, it was announced that the president and first lady had been tested and were awaiting results. Trump revealed in a tweet just before 1 a.m. that they both had tested positive. \"Tonight, @FLOTUS and I\nFact check: False claim that Trump's COVID-19 test result is a 'con' FACT CHECK fact-checking Add Topic Fact check: Claim that Trump's positive COVID-19 test result is a 'con' has no basis in fact Chelsey Cox USA TODAY Oct. 3, 2020 Updated Oct. 4, 2020, 12:12 p.m. ET The claim: President Donald Trump's positive COVID-19 test result might be a 'con' job Social media reactions to the news that President Donald Trump tested positive for the coronavirus ranged from well-wishes to skepticism. On Oct. 2, author and former attorney Richard Greene posted his speculations on Facebook, suggesting Trump's positive test result could be a \"con.\" Greene also wrote a 2016 Huffington Post story : \"Is Donald Trump Mentally Ill? 3 Professors Of Psychiatry Ask President Obama To Conduct \u2018A Full Medical And Neuropsychiatric Evaluation.\u2019\" His post soon went viral. There are three reasons, according to Greene, not to trust the White House's announcement that Trump tested positive: Trump was on his way to losing his reelection bid after his performance during the first presidential debate on Sept. 29. Testing positive for COVID-19 redirected attention away from the topic of white supremacists. By \"sailing through\" a fake illness, Trump could prove his mettle to supporters and emulate Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Greene doesn't trust \"anything that comes out of (Trump's) mouth, or his 'Twitter thumbs.'\" Greene did not mention first lady Melania Trump's positive test result in his post. \"My FB post on it was instantaneous and has received more, and quicker, response ... and more positive response ... than anything I believe I have ever posted,\" Greene told USA TODAY in an email. Greene attributed his skepticism to \"severe cynicism\" after untruths told by Trump during his presidency, as well as a \"Coronavirus October Surprise.\" Trump has made more than 20,000 false or misleading claims during his term, according to a July report by The Washington Post's Fact Checker. \"The term 'October Surprise' was coined by a 1980s political operative but has ever since been appropriated by the media to describe unexpected political disasters in the twilight hours of the campaign,\" the Smithsonian Magazine explained , adding \"they\u2019ve become a staple of modern politics.\" In Greene's view, an \"October surprise\" is one of \"12 Ways Donald Trump Can Win,\" a list compiled by Greene in an Aug. 23 Medium blog post .

The mention of SCOTUS considering restrictions on mail-in ballots indicates ongoing legal scrutiny regarding voting processes, but it does not support the idea that voting multiple times is permissible.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given that the knowledge indicates that voting more than once is illegal and that ballots are tracked, the statement that a man voted four times after receiving four ballot applications is likely false. \n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "It is possible.

Today the NFL honored the organization that yelled \"hope they die\" outside the mothers hospital.", "label": "Refuted", "result": {"response": "To assess the factual accuracy of the statement, let's break it down step-by-step using the provided knowledge points.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statement**: The statement claims that a 6-year-old boy prayed for his mother's life after she was ambushed, and that the NFL honored an organization that yelled \"hope they die\" outside the mother's hospital.\n\n2. **Key Points from the Knowledge**:\n   - The statement involves a tragic event where a mother was ambushed, leading to her son praying for her.\n   - It also mentions an organization that allegedly made a very harsh and inappropriate statement outside the hospital.\n   - The NFL is said to have honored this organization, which raises questions about the appropriateness of such an action.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Claims**:\n   - The first part about the boy praying for his mother could be true, as it reflects a common emotional response in tragic situations.\n   - The second part about the organization yelling \"hope they die\" is a serious accusation and would need to be verified for accuracy.\n   - The claim that the NFL honored this organization is particularly concerning and would require evidence, as it suggests a significant endorsement of a highly controversial and negative action.\n\n4. **Researching the Claims**: \n   - There is no widely reported incident or credible source that confirms the NFL honored an organization that made such a statement. This would likely lead to public outrage and backlash if true.\n   - The nature of the statement made by the organization is extreme and would typically be condemned rather than honored.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of evidence supporting the claim that the NFL honored an organization that made such a statement, and the serious nature of the accusation, it is reasonable to conclude that the statement is false.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 0, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.6}

In the context of the U.S., this would imply periods where military leaders or military governance superseded civilian authority.\n\n2. **Historical Context**: The United States has had a long history of civilian governance since its founding in 1776. While there have been instances of military involvement in governance (e.g., during the Civil War, Reconstruction, and certain periods of martial law), these do not equate to a sustained military rule.\n\n3. **Key Historical Events**:\n   - The U.S. was founded in 1776, and the Constitution was ratified in 1788, establishing civilian governance.\n   - The Civil War (1861-1865) saw military governance in the South during Reconstruction, but this was not a continuous military rule over the entire nation.\n   - There have been instances of martial law declared in specific areas (e.g., during natural disasters or civil unrest), but these are temporary and localized.\n\n4. **Cumulative Time Under Military Rule**: The claim of 29 out of 60 years under military rule would imply that nearly half of the U.S. history has been under military governance, which is not supported by historical records.

Although he was appointed by Trump in 2018, Milley has in many ways been shadow-boxing with the former president since the summer of 2020, when Milley appeared briefly alongside Trump as he walked to a church outside of Lafayette Square for a photo op during the George Floyd protests.

Furthermore, the relative risk of contracting COVID-19 was 0.20 for individuals wearing facemasks within the healthcare setting. Additionally, in community settings, the team noted that 6% of mask wearers and 83% of non-maks wearers tested SARS-CoV-2 positive. The relative risk of contracting COVID-19 in the community setting was 0.08 for mask wearers. The results showed an association between using a facemask and testing positive for COVID-19 since over 92% of the subjects who wore a mask did not test COVID-19 positive. The correlation between COVID-19-positivity and wearing a facemask varied considerably between the healthcare and community settings. Overall, 50% of subjects who did not wear a mask did not contract COVID-19. Notably, 83% and 33% of the subjects who did not wear a facemask in the community and healthcare settings contracted COVID-19, respectively. Compared to healthcare settings, the correlation between contracting COVID-19 and wearing a facemask was greater in the community setting. Overall, the study findings indicated that mask wearers were less likely to contract COVID-19 in healthcare and community settings. It will be necessary to conduct further research as more information becomes available. The researchers believe that future studies are necessary to ascertain the impact of regulations related to facemask usage and other interventions on COVID-19 transmission. *Important notice: medRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.

I didn't see any mention of controlling for these variables. Personally, I had a documented infection Mar 2020. Symptoms were similar to a mild flu, I was over it in 5 days. I lived as normally as possible and hadn't had as much as a sniffle until vaccinated in Nov '21. The vaccine put me in the hospital and felt 10x worse than my first bout with COVID. I recently (Jul '21) tested positive with an at home test. I felt fine, but had a slight runny nose. My father in law had a \"pretty bad cold\" for a few weeks, testing negative a couple times. I tested myself at the first sign of any symptom mostly out of curiosity. I will gladly have a runny nose for a couple days every two years if I don't have to wear a mask most my waking life. I was onboard wearing masks at first if there was any chance of eradicating the disease. The virus is mutating and/or immunity waning too quickly for any chance of eradicating it. We have a new cold virus, I accepted that years ago, it's here to stay if one wears a mask or not.

My mom is a chemo Matt E says: August 9, 2022 at 4:40 PM Except for some people, it's much worse than a cold. My mom is a chemo patient and has a compromised immune system due to the chemo drug, and had both shots+ the booster and still nearly died because her immune system wasn't strong enough for the vaccine to trigger an immune response. This was in late January, with omicron which is supposedly milder. She never leaves the house except to buy groceries, took all the cautions etc. It's sad she nearly died alone and had to listen to so many people complain about mask. It's a minor inconvenience to mask for a few minutes. Surgeons wear them for a reason. 1 0 Reply You are 100% correct Kathleen M says: August 9, 2022 at 11:56 PM Its called being a part and doing your part in your community!

Credit: Reuters/Cheney Orr Due to the speed and manner in which election results have historically been reported, many Americans are unfamiliar with the process election administrators undertake to reach a final vote tally. It is important for voters to understand the way these procedures regularly unfold to reduce uncertainty and increase voters\u2019 confidence in the process. More complete knowledge can allow voters to feel certain and confident in events as they occur, resist disinformation and enable them to recognize when the post-election process has truly gone awry. Election administration in the United States is highly localized. Different states and election jurisdictions (counties, cities or towns) conduct elections in different ways, but typically the local officials responsible for administering elections in their communities conduct most of the post-election procedures. Although specifics vary, election officials in every locality follow a defined set of steps designed to reach a complete and accurate vote count. These multi-step processes build in numerous checks and safeguards to ensure electoral integrity. What follows is an overview of how we get from voters casting ballots \u2013 early or on Election Day, in person or by mail \u2013 to a final determination of the winners of the contests on those ballots. 1. After Votes Are Cast In modern elections, votes are cast through numerous methods. Voters may vote in person (either before or on Election Day), by hand-marking a paper ballot or using an electronic voting machine, or they may submit a ballot by mail, deposit a ballot into a ballot drop-box, or turn in their ballot at a precinct or election office. This section describes how votes are collected immediately after being cast. a. In-Person Voting The majority of in-person voters in the 2020 election cast their vote by marking a paper ballot by hand or with an electronic marking device. Most often, the voter then runs the ballot through a scanner at the polling place to record their vote, but some jurisdictions collect the ballots to be scanned\nreinstate a checkbox that was dropped from Florida absentee ballots in 2021. The checkbox allowed the voter to request an absentee ballot for the next election. Mail-in ballot security Following concerns about the security of mail-in ballots in the 2000 election in Florida, the 2002 Help America Vote Act required that all states have a minimum security requirement. The multiple levels of scrutiny include signature comparison, ballot tracking and penalties for malfeasance from the moment of registration to ballot request, to ballot receipt. With these layers of security there were only an estimated four fraudulent votes cast for every 10 million mail-in ballots in the 2016, 2018, 2020 and 2022 U.S. general elections. Mail-in voting elsewhere The United States is one of 32 countries worldwide that allow mail-in voting for at least some of its citizens. These include the United Kingdom since 1945 and Germany since 1957 . In Germany\u2019s federal elections in 2025, 37% of all voters, or 18.5 million citizens , cast a ballot by mail. German citizens who are eligible to vote automatically receive ballots . In the United Kingdom\u2019s 2024 election, just under 5%, or nearly 1.3 million citizens , applied for mail-in ballots. The bottom line The Supreme Court case could reshape the voting landscape in the United States, potentially affecting 47 million people, including some 5 million military and civilian voters living abroad . Watson v. Republican National Committee could also affect laws in 29 states. The outcome of the case has the potential to make voting more difficult for millions of civilian and military voters at home and abroad.

However, five of those states (Colorado, Oregon, Utah, Hawaii and Washington) have been holding their elections primarily by mail since before the pandemic, so voters who register in these states do so knowing they\u2019ll likely submit their ballot by mail. The four remaining states (California, Vermont, Nevada, and New Jersey) plus Washington DC switched this year \u2014 so, voters there who were already registered didn\u2019t actively request a mail-in ballot for this election.

The five places that changed their policies for this election to send ballots to all voters \u2013 DC , California , Vermont, Nevada and New Jersey \u2013 have at least 29 million registered voters by the latest available count. Based on this data, the number of truly unsolicited ballots sent out is at most, around half of what the President claims, and likely even less. It\u2019s also worth noting that even in the unsolicited instances, states have safeguards in place to prevent the kind of fraud Trump implies will result from the projected increase in voting by mail this election.

What\u2019s new this year: \u2022 A dedicated Software category\nreceived an assignment the year earlier, when he tested positive for cocaine . In 2015 Beau Biden died of brain cancer , and his death sent Hunter Biden\u2019s life into a downward spiral. Hunter and Kathleen Biden\u2019s marriage had been failing, and in October 2015 they formally separated. They were divorced in 2017. Also in 2017, news reports surfaced that Hunter Biden was in a romantic relationship with Hallie Olivere Biden, Beau Biden\u2019s widow. Their relationship would end two years later. During this time Beau went through multiple periods of alcohol and drug binges followed by rehab efforts. In 2018 Hunter Biden fathered a daughter, Navy Joan Roberts, with Lunden Alexis Roberts of Arkansas. In his 2021 memoir, Beautiful Things , Hunter Biden wrote that he had \u201cno recollection\u201d of his encounter with Roberts. In May 2019 Biden married Melissa Cohen, a South African filmmaker. The couple had a baby boy in 2020. Hunter Biden took up painting as a form of therapy while recovering from his addictions. He credits Cohen for his sobriety. Legal troubles and pardon In 2020 Hunter Biden disclosed that the Justice Department has been investigating him since late 2018. The investigation was led by David C. Weiss, the U.S. attorney in Delaware, and involved potential criminal violations of tax and money-laundering laws. In June 2023 Hunter Biden agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor counts of failing to pay his 2016 and 2017 taxes on time. He also accepted conditions that would avoid his being prosecuted on a felony charge that he lied when he said he was sober when buying a handgun in 2018. But the plea deal collapsed when the judge in the case refused to be what she called \u201ca rubber stamp\u201d on the agreement that some said reflected preferential treatment of the first son. In August 2023 U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland announced that Weiss had been named the special counsel in charge of the investigation, and prosecutors filed court documents saying that they expected the Biden case to go to trial. In June 2024 Biden went on trial for the gun-related charges, and he was found guilty on all three counts later that month. He thus became the first child of a sitting U.S. president to be convicted of a crime. In September 2024 Biden pleaded guilty to three felony counts and six misdemeanors in his federal tax case.

Watch the conversation in the video player above. The president and his wife are both displaying symptoms, though White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said they are mild. In a memo Friday afternoon, White House physician Sean Conley said Trump received a single 8-gram dose of Regeneron's polyclonal antibody cocktail as treatment, adding that the president \"remains fatigued but in good spirits.\" The White House released a statement on Friday-- less than 24 hours after his positive test was announced-- that the president was being moved to Walter Reed hospital. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said that Trump \"remains in good spirits\" but will be moved to Walter Reed and working from there for the coming days \"out of an abundance of caution, and at the recommendation of his physician and medical experts.\" The news of Trump's diagnosis sparked a flurry of questions over the future of Trump's campaign, the dozens of people he's had contact with in recent days, as well as how the illness will affect his presidential duties. PBS NewsHour's William Brangham and Yamiche Alcindor answered questions from viewers about Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis and what this means for the 2020 election. How did the news of Trump's diagnosis unfold? Bloomberg News first reported on Thursday night that Trump's senior adviser Hope Hicks had tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday. Shortly after, it was announced that the president and first lady had been tested and were awaiting results. Trump revealed in a tweet just before 1 a.m. that they both had tested positive. \"Tonight, @FLOTUS and I\nthat Trump's senior adviser Hope Hicks had tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday. Shortly after, it was announced that the president and first lady had been tested and were awaiting results. Trump revealed in a tweet just before 1 a.m. that they both had tested positive. \"Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19,\" Trump tweeted. \"We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!\" In a memo shortly after Trump's tweet, Dr. Conley wrote, \"The President and First Lady are both well at this time, and they plan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence.\" Trump's Friday schedule, which was set to include a trip to a campaign rally in Florida, was cleared except for one phone call to discuss \"COVID-19 support to vulnerable seniors.\" How could COVID-19 potentially affect Trump? Trump is 74 years old, which puts him at higher risk of experiencing more severe COVID-19 symptoms. People between the ages of 65 and 74 are nearly five times more likely to be hospitalized for COVID-19 related complications than those between ages 18 and 29, according to June data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People 75 to 84 years old are about 7 times more likely to be hospitalized than the 18 to 29 age group. \"There's no evidence that [Trump] is seeing or experiencing any conflicts or any particular serious symptoms as of right now,\" Alcindor said to Brangham. \"But I want to reiterate that we're talking about a senior citizen, and someone who falls in the group of people that Dr. [Anthony] Fauci and so many other health officials have said have to be extra vigilant when it comes to this virus.\" Gary Simon, a medical doctor and director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at George Washington University, told the PBS NewsHour that it's unclear at this point how the virus will affect Trump's heath. \"It's very hard to predict simply based on the epidemiology, how he's going to do. Certainly he's going to do worse than somebody with the same symptoms who's 25 years old,\" Simon said. \"But the markers that predict disease are mostly laboratory markers, and we don't know any of those.\" Throughout his first term the White House has been vague regarding the details of Trump's health. Earlier this summer, Conley declared the president to be in good\nMisinformation, Speculation Follow Trump COVID-19 Diagnosis - FactCheck.org Facebook Twitter Tumblr Close Skip to main content FactCheck .org \u00ae A Project of The Annenberg Public Policy Center The news that President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump contracted the novel coronavirus led to a wave of social media posts spreading misinformation \u2014 and politically charged speculation. Some of posts tapped into baseless conspiracy theories, and others shared outright falsehoods, as we\u2019ll explain. First, here\u2019s some of what we know about the matter: Trump announced early Oct. 2 on Twitter that he had tested positive for the virus, which causes COVID-19. \u201c Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER! \u201d he wrote shortly before 1 a.m. That announcement followed breaking news by Bloomberg News that a Trump aide, Hope Hicks, had tested positive for the virus. Hicks had been traveling with Trump in recent days. The White House later released a memo from Dr. Sean P. Conley, Trump\u2019s White House physician, dated Oct. 1, which in part said: \u201cThis evening I received confirmation that President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump have tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\u201d White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told reporters that the president was experiencing \u201cmild symptoms.\u201d A subsequent memo from Conley specified that Trump had \u201cPCR-confirmation\u201d \u2014 a reference to a standard testing method \u2014 and said Trump received a \u201csingle 8 gram dose of Regeneron\u2019s polyclonal antibody cocktail\u201d and other medicine. The \u201cPresident remains fatigued but in good spirits,\u201d Conley said, adding that Melania Trump \u201cremains well with only a mild cough and headache.\u201d Later in the day, the White House announced Trump would go to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center . Speculation, Conspiracy Theories Floated In the hours immediately following Trump\u2019s announcement, with few other details available, some turned to speculation. Others shared conspiracy theories. Among the posts to gain traction online were posts suggesting that the president was not actually sick, but using a fabricated diagnosis to benefit his reelection campaign. On the other side, some implied without substantiation that \u201cthe left\u201d may have deliberately spread the virus to him. Neither notion is supported by available evidence.

This directly contradicts the statement, as it shows that a nominee was indeed nominated and confirmed while a presidential election was underway.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the information that Amy Coney Barrett was nominated and confirmed during an election year, the statement that a Supreme Court nominee has never been nominated and installed while a presidential election is already underway is false.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "U.S. Senate: Supreme Court Nominations (1789-Present) Skip Content Supreme Court Nominations (1789-Present) The Constitution requires the president to submit nominations to the Senate for its advice and consent.

When Justice Anthony Kennedy retired from the Supreme Court in June 2018, Barrett was allegedly among the finalists to fill the vacancy. The job would go to Justice Brett Kavanaugh, but Trump reportedly told his advisers that he was \u201csaving\u201d Barrett in case Ginsburg were to leave the court during his presidency. Barrett\u2019s nomination and confirmation process played out against the backdrop of President Barack Obama\u2019s March 2016 nomination of Merrick Garland, the highly respected chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to fill the vacancy created by Scalia\u2019s 2016 death. Senate Republicans refused to hold a hearing for Garland, then 63 years old and generally regarded as a more centrist nominee. They maintained that it was too close to the upcoming presidential election, and that the next president, rather than Obama, should choose the new nominee. The seat remained open until April 2017, when Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump\u2019s first Supreme Court nominee, was confirmed. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) paved the way for Barrett\u2019s 2020 nomination last year. When asked at a May 2019 luncheon in Kentucky whether he would fill a vacancy if a Supreme Court justice were to leave the court in 2020, McConnell responded that he would. The difference between such an opening and the situation in 2016, McConnell explained, was that the White House and the Senate in 2016 were controlled by different political parties, while Republicans now hold both the Senate and the White House. But although Ginsburg had announced in December 2018 that she had been treated for lung cancer (the third of what would eventually prove to be five cancer diagnoses), the vacancy was at the time purely a hypothetical one. The hypothetical became real after Ginsburg\u2019s death in September, and McConnell pledged to fill the vacancy quickly. The president was reportedly considering Barrett and two other women \u2013 Judge Barbara Lagoa, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, and Judge Allison Jones Rushing, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit \u2013 to fill the opening left by Ginsburg\u2019s death. But it\u2019s not clear that either woman was ever actually seriously in the running, as the president offered Barrett the job on Sept. 21 and nominated her on Sept. 26,\nbut chief executives in both parties have increasingly done so. Trump\u2019s appointment of Barrett to the Supreme Court in 2020 made her just the fifth woman ever to serve on the high court , after former justices Sandra Day O\u2019Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg and current justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Trump appointed a smaller share of non-White federal judges than other recent presidents. About one-in-six of the judges appointed by Trump (16%) are Black, Hispanic, Asian or another race or ethnicity. That\u2019s slightly below the proportion of non-White judges appointed by the last Republican president, George W. Bush (18%), and well below the share appointed by the last three Democratic presidents \u2013 Obama (36%), Clinton (25%) and Jimmy Carter (22%). As is the case with women judges, Democratic presidents have generally been more likely than their GOP counterparts to appoint racial or ethnic minorities to the bench. It isn\u2019t yet clear whether Democratic President-elect Joe Biden will need to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court during his tenure. Should a vacancy arise, Biden has vowed to appoint a Black woman . No Black woman has ever served on the Supreme Court. More than a quarter of currently active federal judges are now Trump appointees. As of Jan. 13, there were 816 active judges serving across the three main tiers of the federal court system : the Supreme Court, 13 regional appeals courts and 91 district courts governed by Article III of the U.S. Constitution. Trump appointed 28% of those judges. That includes three of the nine sitting Supreme Court justices, 30% of the nation\u2019s active appeals court judges and 27% of active district court judges. (The number of active federal judges changes regularly because of retirements, resignations, new appointments and other reasons.) Obama appointed the largest share of currently active federal judges at 38%, while George W. Bush named 20% of the total. Clinton appointed 11% and George H.W. Bush and Reagan each appointed 2%. One active federal judge, Carmen Consuelo Cerezo of the District of Puerto Rico, was appointed by Carter. Note: This is an update of a post originally published on July 15, 2020.

But it\u2019s not clear that either woman was ever actually seriously in the running, as the president offered Barrett the job on Sept. 21 and nominated her on Sept. 26, in a ceremony at the White House that was notable for the dearth of masks and social distancing. At least 11 people who attended the ceremony later tested positive for COVID-19, including the president, two senators, and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. By the time Barrett\u2019s confirmation hearings began on Oct. 12, Democrats had few options to stop the nomination. Instead, they frequently argued that, if confirmed, Barrett would provide a key vote to strike down the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate and, with it, the rest of the law when the Supreme Court hears oral argument on Nov. 10 in a challenge to the mandate. Republican senators emphasized Barrett\u2019s qualifications for the job and her commitment to following the original meaning of the Constitution. Some senators, like Josh Hawley of Missouri, also condemned what they portrayed as attacks on Barrett\u2019s religion. When the Senate Judiciary Committee met on Oct. 22 to consider whether to send Barrett\u2019s nomination to the full Senate, Democratic senators were not there. Knowing they did not have the votes to stop the nomination from moving forward, several of them left photos of their constituents to fill their chairs \u2013 a move intended to symbolize the people who would be hurt if the ACA were struck down. Without any Democratic opposition, Barrett\u2019s nomination was voted out of committee unanimously. Going into Monday\u2019s final vote, there was little suspense about how the vote might turn out. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) had opposed moving forward with the confirmation process this close to the election, but she announced on Saturday that she would support Barrett\u2019s confirmation. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who had voted two years ago to confirm Kavanaugh, announced that she would vote against Barrett. No Democrats crossed party lines to vote for Barrett. In a ceremony at the White House shortly after the vote, Justice Clarence Thomas administered the constitutional oath, one of the two oaths that Barrett must take. The Supreme Court\u2019s Public Information Office announced on Monday night that Chief Justice John Roberts would administer the second oath, the judicial oath, on Tuesday in\nBarrett confirmed as 115th justice - SCOTUSblog Skip to content Barrett confirmed as 115th justice By Amy Howe on Oct 27, 2020 The Senate on Monday night confirmed Judge Amy Coney Barrett as the 115th justice of the U.S. Supreme Court and the fifth woman to serve on the court. The 48-year-old Barrett fills the seat previously held by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died on Sept. 18 of complications from pancreatic cancer. The 52-48 vote capped a meteoric rise for Barrett, who spent almost all of her career as a law professor who was well regarded but little known outside academic circles. And for conservatives, the vote represented the culmination of a decades-long effort to move the ideological balance on the court solidly to the right. In contrast to Ginsburg, who spent nearly three decades as one of the court\u2019s most reliably liberal votes, Barrett has said that her judicial philosophy is similar to that of the late conservative hero Justice Antonin Scalia, for whom Barrett served as a law clerk. Democrats decried the decision to confirm Barrett less than two weeks before the upcoming presidential election, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) warned that the \u201cAmerican people will suffer the consequences of Judge Barrett\u2019s far-right, out-of-the-mainstream views for generations.\u201d Barrett catapulted onto the national scene in 2017, during the confirmation hearings for her seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit. Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee suggested that Barrett, who is a devout Catholic, might allow her faith to influence her judging \u2013 an allegation that Barrett staunchly denied. And perhaps most notably, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California told Barrett that, based on Barrett\u2019s speeches, \u201cthe conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within you.\u201d Feinstein\u2019s rhetoric did not keep Barrett from being confirmed to the court of appeals, by a vote of 55 to 43, on Oct. 31, 2017. In fact, it may have had the opposite effect: Conservative Catholics adopted the phrase as a rallying cry, putting it on coffee mugs and t-shirts, and Barrett\u2019s name was one of five names added in November 2017 to President Donald Trump\u2019s list of potential nominees to the Supreme Court.

Featured Weekly Ad\nthe advancement of Barrett's nomination so close to Election Day, after the Republican-led Senate in 2016 refused to hold hearings for then-President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, nearly eight months before that year's election. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., labeled the nomination process a \"cynical power grab.\" \"Nearly every Republican in this chamber led by the majority leader four years ago refused to even consider the Supreme Court nomination of a Democratic president on the grounds ... that we should wait until after the presidential election because the American people deserved a voice in the selection of their next justice,\" he said on Sunday. \"My colleagues, there is no escaping this glaring hypocrisy. As I said before, no tit-for-tat convoluted, distorted version of history will wipe away the stain that will exist forever with this Republican majority and with this Republican leader.\" Barrett's nomination cleared a procedural hurdle Sunday afternoon when the Senate voted to end debate on the nomination, days after Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee boycotted a vote to advance Barrett's nomination. The only Republicans who voted against the cloture motion on Sunday were Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. On Saturday, Murkowski previewed her intentions, saying she planned to vote against moving the nomination forward procedurally but would vote to confirm Barrett on Monday. \"While I oppose the process that led us to this point, I do not hold it against her, as an individual who has navigated the gauntlet with grace, skill and humility,\" she said. Collins faces a tough reelection battle and said after Ginsburg's death in September that whoever wins the presidential election should fill the Supreme Court vacancy . The 48-year-old judge's confirmation solidifies the court's conservative majority, potentially shaping the future of abortion rights and health care law for generations.

A bystander\u2019s video showed officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for about nine minutes in Minneapolis, Minnesota, as Floyd pleaded that he couldn\u2019t breathe.

Five years later, that falsehood is central to calls for President Donald Trump to pardon Chauvin. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a member of Trump\u2019s Republican Party from Georgia, for example, recently revived her longstanding and long-debunked take that Chauvin did not cause Floyd\u2019s death. \u201cI strongly support Derek Chauvin being pardoned and released from prison,\u201d Greene wrote in a May 14 X post. \u201cGeorge Floyd died of a drug overdose.\u201d In 2021, a Minnesota jury convicted Chauvin of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.

However, the timeline of events is crucial. Kayla Mueller was captured in 2013, and she was reported dead in early 2015.

[ 36 ] New York Post reporting On October 14, 2020, the New York Post published articles containing purported emails of unknown authorship which suggested that Hunter Biden provided an \"opportunity\" to Vadym Pozharskyi, an advisor to the board of Burisma, to meet his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden. [ 2 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Joe Biden stated in September 2019 that he had never spoken to his son about his foreign business dealings. [ 39 ] His presidential campaign denied such a meeting took place and stated the New York Post had never contacted them \"about the critical elements of this story\". [ 40 ] Michael Carpenter, Vice President Biden's foreign policy adviser in 2015, told The Washington Post that he had accompanied Joe Biden during all of his meetings about Ukraine: \"He never met with [Pozharskyi]. In fact, I had never heard of this guy until the New York Post story broke.\" [ 41 ] One of the purported emails showed Pozharskyi saying he would share information with Amos Hochstein , a State Department advisor close to Vice President Biden, though Hochstein stated, \"The Republican Senate investigation subpoenaed all my records, including emails and calendars and found no mention of this man. I led the US energy efforts in Ukraine and never even heard of him before yesterday.\" [ 42 ] According to an investigation by The New York Times, editors at the New York Post \"pressed staff members to add their bylines to the story\", and at least one refused, in addition to the original author, reportedly because of a lack of confidence in its credibility. Of the two writers eventually credited on the article, the second did not know her name was attached to it until after The Post published it. [ 33 ] In its opening sentence, the New York Post story misleadingly asserted, \"the elder Biden pressured government officials in Ukraine into firing a prosecutor who was investigating\" Burisma, even though Shokin had not pursued an investigation into Burisma's founder. [ 41 ] The opening sentence also misleadingly stated that Hunter Biden introduced his father to Pozharskyi, but the purported email from Pozharskyi only mentioned an invitation and \"opportunity\" for the men to meet. [ 43 ] [ 44 ] On October 15, the Post published another article regarding a business venture relating to\nIn Wisconsin Speech, Pence Calls Biden A 'Trojan Horse' For Socialism - WPR Vice President Mike Pence called his Democratic opponents socialists and warned that presumptive nominee Joe Biden was a \u201cTrojan horse for a radical agenda\u201d in a speech Friday at Wisconsin\u2019s Ripon College. Pence touted the economy of the first three years of the Trump administration, and said Trump took \u201cextraordinary action\u201d to combat the COVID-19 pandemic this year. But the bulk of the address, which was billed as a \u201cmajor speech\u201d by Trump campaign officials, focused on defining Biden as an agent of the radical left. Pence connected Biden to former Democratic primary candidate Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and other self-identified democratic socialists in the party.

URL This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. Email \u201cOur road leads to greater freedom and opportunity,\u201d Pence said. \u201cTheir road leads to socialism and decline.\u201d Biden was perceived as a moderate candidate in the Democratic primary, defeating candidates like Sanders who called for more dramatic policy shifts on health care and economic inequality. The Biden campaign recently released a policy document under the name \u201cBiden-Sanders Unity Task Force\u201d that laid out new proposals intended to combat climate change and reform the nation\u2019s criminal justice system . Of the document, Pence said, \u201cthe only thing it ended up unifying was Joe Biden to the radical left.\u201d The Biden campaign blasted Pence\u2019s visit ahead of the speech. In a statement, deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said that \u201cthe Trump campaign is once again sending Vice President Mike Pence to the Badger State to do damage control for this administration\u2019s historic failure of leadership.\u201d Recent polls show Biden with a clear lead in Wisconsin. Polling averages find Biden is leading Trump in the state by about 7 points . In response to the national wave of protests that followed the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police, Pence called it a \u201cfalse choice\u201d to say that supporting police is in conflict with \u201cstanding with our African American neighbors.\u201d He repeatedly emphasized the Trump administration\u2019s support for police, and criticized Biden for saying that systemic racism was real and that police have implicit bias against Black people. \u201cWe will stand with those\nBiden and the Burisma advisor Vadym Pozharskyi. The Biden campaign denied Joe Biden had any meeting with Pozharskyi and said that if they had ever met, it would have been a brief encounter. [ 28 ] Witnesses at the dinner where they allegedly met said Joe Biden briefly passed by to see an old friend. The Post reported in its story that Pozharskyi declined to comment, and he did not comment to a Politico journalist who reported extensively on the story a year later. [ 29 ] The Post reported that the email was found in a cache of data extracted from the external hard drive of a laptop computer that belonged to Hunter Biden. The Post reported that the repair shop owner had made a copy of the external hard drive before it was seized by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and that the copy was later provided to the Post by Donald Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani . The subpoena to seize the laptop was issued by a grand jury on behalf of the US attorney's office in Wilmington, which was later reported to have been investigating Hunter Biden about lobbying and financial matters since at least 2018. [ 1 ] [ 12 ] The veracity of the Post 's reporting was strongly questioned by many mainstream media outlets and analysts due to the initially unclear origin and chain of custody of the laptop and the provenance of its contents. Due to prior Russian influence campaigns during the 2016 election, particularly the release of documents obtained by Russian cyber attacks targeting John Podesta and the Democratic National Committee , media outlets and intelligence officials also became suspicious of a possible disinformation campaign by Russian intelligence or its proxies. Analysts also suspected Russian involvement in the 2017 leaks of emails involving French president Emmanuel Macron two days before national elections, which contained fake emails mingled with genuine ones. [ 30 ] Adding to concerns, Giuliani had met with Andrii Derkach , later confirmed to be a Russian agent, [ 31 ] [ 32 ] while conducting opposition research against Joe Biden in Ukraine in 2019.

Different versions of the claim suggest they were FBI operatives or members of the anti-fascist movement antifa . \"Earlier today, the Capitol was under siege by people who can only be described as antithetical to the MAGA movement,\" Laura Ingraham said on her Fox News show the night of Jan. 6, referring to Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" slogan. \"They were likely not all Trump supporters, and there are some reports that antifa sympathizers may have been sprinkled throughout the crowd.\" The next day, Ingraham acknowledged the inaccuracy when she tweeted a link to a story debunking the claim. Another Fox host, Tucker Carlson, has spread the idea that the FBI orchestrated the riot. He cites as evidence the indictments of some Jan. 6 suspects that mention unindicted co-conspirators, a common legal term that merely refers to suspects who haven't been charged, and not evidence of undercover agents or informants. Yet Carlson claimed on his show that \"in potentially every single case, they were FBI operatives.\" Carlson is a \"main driver\" of the idea that Jan. 6 was perpetrated by agents of the government, according to Zignal's report. It found the claim spiked in October when Carlson released a documentary series about the insurrection. Members of Congress, including Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., have helped spread the theories. \"Some of the people who breached the Capitol today were not Trump supporters, they were masquerading as Trump supporters and, in fact, were members of the violent terrorist group antifa,\" Gaetz said. Spokespeople for Carlson and Gaetz say they stand by their claims. In truth, the rioters are just who they said they were . One was a recently elected state lawmaker from West Virginia, a Republican Trump supporter named Derrick Evans who resigned following his arrest. Evans streamed video of himself illegally entering the Capitol. \"They're making an announcement now saying if Pence\nterrorist attack and he currently in prison serving two life sentences without the possibility of parole. In response to the deadly violence perpetrated by Fields, Trump claimed that there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d and in the first presidential debate refused to condemn violent right-wing groups. His remarks were widely criticized. Are they really a threat? At least one death has been attributed to a person affiliated wth the Antifa movement. On August 29, a member of the far-right group \u201cPatriot Prayer\u201d who was part of a pro-Trump caravan in Portland, Oregon, died after being shot . The man accused of the killing, Michael Reinoehl, was shot by US marshals five days later. Overall, however, data show that Antifa activists have been involved in relatively few violent incidents compared to white supremacists, who have conducted at least 40 lethal attacks since 2018 according to the Department of Homeland Security. Despite this, Trump and his attorney general, William Barr, have accused the Antifa movement of being the main instigators of violence, looting and public unrest. This is what serves as justification for the administration\u2019s labeling them as \u201ca domestic terrorist group\u201d. For both legal and political reasons, such accusations are immediately met with scepticism and criticism. Because the United States has no domestic terror law \u2013 something opposed by both progressive and conservative public officials \u2013 the only possibility would be to place the Antifa movement on the list of \u201cforeign terrorist organizations\u201d, something that has no basis in fact. The alternative would be take thousands of activists to court, thus criminalizing political beliefs and violating fundamental rights guaranteed by the US Constitution. A polarized country So does the Antifa movement represent a real threat to American democracy? Let us look more broadly at the partisan, political conflict that is being felt across the country. The Antifa movement is part of a polarization of political views that is eroding one the foundations of the American republic, the mutual recognition of the legitimacy of both political sides. The groups against which the Antifa movement positions itself, including white supremacists, neo-fascists and right-wing nationalists , have been involved in numerous violent actions and killings . However, the Antifa movement\u2019s own actions can contribute to the legitimization of violence, escalate conflicts rather than defuse them, and expose peaceful protesters to danger. Calls for violence , whatever the source, can also be used\n1 Person Dead In Shooting That Followed Day Of Far-Right, Far-Left Rallies In Denver : NPR Accessibility links Skip to main content Keyboard shortcuts for audio player 1 Person Dead In Shooting That Followed Day Of Far-Right, Far-Left Rallies In Denver Police said a private security guard was taken into custody as a suspect in connection with the shooting.

Contracting private security to protect reporters and producers at protests has been a practice at the outlet for several months, 9News said. The shooting took place near the Denver Art Museum when competing far-left and far-right protests were winding down nearby. Activists from the far left were in the area for a Black Lives Matter Anti-Fascist Soup Drive organized by the Denver Communists, the Colorado Socialist Revolution and other groups, according to Colorado Public Radio . The right-wing demonstrators had gathered for what was billed as a Patriot Muster organized by John \"Tig\"\n7, 2021 That man was later identified as Jake Angeli, a noted supporter of a conspiracy cult called Qanon and a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump. Angeli is a well-known protester covered previously by Arizona Central . Supporters had planned the events online , using social media apps like Parler to express support for the rallies scheduled on Thursday. Other false claims also indicated that Antifa protestors were \u201cescorted\u201d into the Capitol by police to cause the disruption. Metropolitan police denied the claim, telling Reuters they do not act as a private security escort. If the identification of well-known right-wing activists is not convincing enough to dispel the notion that Antifa was involved in the Capitol, consider Trump\u2019s own messages to the rioters he was telling to go home. \u201cWe love you, you\u2019re very special,\u201d he told them in a video that was later taken down by Twitter and Facebook. \u201cBut go home, and go home in peace.\u201d Copyright 2021 by KSAT - All rights reserved.

Johnson has since said that he doesn't want the violent actions of a few to be used to impugn all. Rep. Andrew Clyde, after watching video footage of rioters walking through the Capitol, said it resembled a \"normal tourist visit.\" Other video evidence from Jan. 6 showed Clyde, R-Ga., helping barricade the House doors in an attempt to keep the rioters out. Trump called the insurrection a display of \" spirit and faith and love .\" Rioters also broke windows and doors, stole items from offices and caused an estimated $1.5 million in damage. Outside the Capitol someone set up a gallows with a noose . \"The notion that this was somehow a tourist event is disgraceful and despicable,\" Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said in May. \"And, you know, I won't be part of whitewashing what happened on Jan. 6. Nobody should be part of it. And people ought to be held accountable.\" ___ CLAIM: TRUMP DID NOT ENCOURAGE THE RIOTERS Trump may now want to minimize his involvement, but he spent months sounding a steady drumbeat of conspiracy theory and grievance, urging his followers to fight to somehow return him to power. \"Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,\" Trump tweeted on Dec. 19, 2020. \"Be there, will be wild!\" Immediately before the mob stormed the Capitol, Trump spoke for more than an hour, telling his supporters they had been \"cheated\" and \"defrauded\" in the \"rigged\" election by a \"criminal enterprise\" that included lawmakers who were now meeting in the Capitol. At one point, Trump did urge his supporters to \"peacefully and patriotically make your voice heard.\" The rest of his speech was filled with hostile rhetoric. \"We fight. We fight like hell,\" he told those who would later break into the Capitol. \"And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\" Now, Trump says he had nothing to do with the riot. \"I wasn't involved in that, and if you look at my words and what I said in the speech, they were extremely calming actually,\" Trump said on Fox News in December. Nearly two-thirds of Americans believe Trump bears some responsibility for the Capitol breach, according to a survey last year by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. ___ CLAIM: ASHLI BABBITT WAS KILLED BY AN"}], "source": "rag_only"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 5, "concluded_by_rag": true, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.6}

Bloom\u2019s mother, Gloria Allred, is an attorney representing several women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct . Trump had been given a tentative court date for the civil lawsuit of 16 December and has denied all the accusations made against him.

[ 20 ] In July 2023, Judge Kaplan stated that the jury had found that Trump had raped Carroll according to the common definition of the word as they had ruled that Trump had forcibly and nonconsensually penetrated Carroll's vagina with his fingers. [ 21 ] New York state's definition at the time defined rape as solely nonconsensual penetration of the vagina by a penis.

[ 26 ] The allegations by Ivana Trump and Jill Harth became public before Trump's presidential candidacy with the rest going public after the 2005 Access Hollywood tape was leaked during the 2016 presidential campaign in which Trump was recorded bragging that a celebrity like himself \"can do anything\" to women, including \"just start kissing them ... I don't even wait\" and \"grab 'em by the pussy \". Trump denied behaving that way toward women and apologized for the crude language. Many of his accusers stated that Trump's denials provoked them into going public. Several former Miss USA and Miss Teen USA contestants accused Trump of entering the dressing rooms of beauty pageant contestants while contestants were in various stages of undress. Trump had already referred to this practice during a 2005 interview on The Howard Stern Show , saying he could \"get away with things like that\" because he owned the Miss Universe franchise. In October 2019, the book All the President's Women: Donald Trump and the\nDonald Trump sexual misconduct allegations - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Since the 1970s, at least 28 women have accused Donald Trump of various acts of sexual misconduct, [ 1 ] including rape, kissing and groping without consent, looking under women's skirts, and walking in on naked teenage pageant contestants.

The most recent, from writer and columnist E. Jean Carroll, appeared in NY Magazine on Friday. The women's charges range from unwanted touches and aggressive, sudden kissing to the latest accusation against Trump -- that he attacked a woman in a dressing room and forced his penis inside her. Donald Trump, his campaign and the Trump White House have insisted all of the stories are fabricated and politically motivated. So far: 16 women have accused Donald Trump of various forms of sexual assault, including one accusation of rape and another, in which the accuser has not used the word \"rape\" but whose description meets the legal definition of rape. This figure includes standing accusations from both before and after the release of the Access Hollywood tape on October 7, 2016. Four other women have publicly said Mr. Trump walked in on them and other pageant contestants while they were undressing. Buzzfeed reports another three women have confirmed the pageant stories but did not want their names used. The alleged incidents range from the early 1980s to 2013. Donald Trump has adamantly denied all of the stories and accuses the women of being political tools who were trying to undermine either his candidacy or presidency.

Carole Fader Oct. 30, 2011, 12:01 a.m. ET Times-Union readers want to know: I received an email that says a Kiwanis group met at an Oxford, Ala., Olive Garden restaurant and were told that they couldn't display their flag or the American flag because of a corporate policy against it. What is going on? Many chain emails seem to deal with corporations who ban something or someone. Usually, they are just plain false, or big misunderstandings. This one is different. The flap started when the Oxford Kiwanis club held its annual meeting, according to The Anniston Star. Marty Warren, the vice president and immediate past president, said the group had planned to hang the U.S. flag so members could say the Pledge of Allegiance at the start of the meeting. Many of the members there were veterans and were upset when told the flag would be unavailable, Warren told the Star. Warren said that a manager at the restaurant told her that Olive Garden had a corporate policy against allowing any group to hang a banner or flag in its restaurants that did not have a private meeting space. In a private room, the manager said, a gathering would not disturb other patrons. The Oxford eatery has no such space. The Star reported that Heidi Schauer, a spokeswoman for Orlando-based Darden Restaurants, which owns Olive Garden, confirmed this policy to the newspaper in an email. She also told the Star: \"Like all Americans we have nothing but the utmost respect and admiration for the American flag and everything it symbolizes. In fact, we periodically provide American flag collar pins to our employees to wear while serving guests. We understand and appreciate the way some people have reacted to the situation in Oxford and we're very sorry if this decision has caused them any concern.\" Company clarifies A week later, the Star reported, Olive Garden clarified its position, saying that there had been some miscommunication. In a statement made available on Olive Garden's Facebook page, Schauer said the restaurant did not actually have a policy banning the American flag and would \"welcome anyone who wishes to bring the flag into our restaurants.\" \"Some members of our team were misinformed about\nPolitiFact | Olive Garden hasn\u2019t banned American flag masks English Espa\u00f1ol Stand up for the facts!

Different versions of the claim suggest they were FBI operatives or members of the anti-fascist movement antifa . \"Earlier today, the Capitol was under siege by people who can only be described as antithetical to the MAGA movement,\" Laura Ingraham said on her Fox News show the night of Jan. 6, referring to Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" slogan. \"They were likely not all Trump supporters, and there are some reports that antifa sympathizers may have been sprinkled throughout the crowd.\" The next day, Ingraham acknowledged the inaccuracy when she tweeted a link to a story debunking the claim. Another Fox host, Tucker Carlson, has spread the idea that the FBI orchestrated the riot. He cites as evidence the indictments of some Jan. 6 suspects that mention unindicted co-conspirators, a common legal term that merely refers to suspects who haven't been charged, and not evidence of undercover agents or informants. Yet Carlson claimed on his show that \"in potentially every single case, they were FBI operatives.\" Carlson is a \"main driver\" of the idea that Jan. 6 was perpetrated by agents of the government, according to Zignal's report. It found the claim spiked in October when Carlson released a documentary series about the insurrection. Members of Congress, including Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., have helped spread the theories. \"Some of the people who breached the Capitol today were not Trump supporters, they were masquerading as Trump supporters and, in fact, were members of the violent terrorist group antifa,\" Gaetz said. Spokespeople for Carlson and Gaetz say they stand by their claims. In truth, the rioters are just who they said they were . One was a recently elected state lawmaker from West Virginia, a Republican Trump supporter named Derrick Evans who resigned following his arrest. Evans streamed video of himself illegally entering the Capitol. \"They're making an announcement now saying if Pence\ncivil dialogue.

The schemes mentioned (PMJJBY and PMSBY) are part of the broader efforts to provide financial security to families in the wake of the pandemic.\n\n4. **Claim Process**: Families of deceased individuals can claim benefits under these schemes if the deceased was enrolled in them at the time of death.\n\nBased on this information, the statement that the Government of India is providing money to bereaved families of COVID-19 victims through insurance benefits under PMJJBY and PMSBY is accurate.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"True\"\n}\n```", "answer": "True"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "early signs most people miss 6 detox water recipes that can support weight loss and clear skin What every woman needs to unlearn about her health: The truth you must know 1 2 3 Hot Picks Big Beautiful Bill Chicago Shooting HDB Financial Services Post Office Saving Schemes Anti Trump Protests Skydiving plane crashes Gold Price Prediction Top Trending Cardi B Tom Brady Taylor Swift Trail Blazer Napheesa Collier Caitlyn Jenner Puka Nacuas Bryan Braman India vs England Test live Tamil Nadu Custodial Death Tired of too many ads? go ad free now Trending Stories In India Entire Website 'Ghana ghoom rahe hain': Sanjay Raut takes 'vikas purush' jibe at PM Modi, flags poor roads in Varanasi Uttarakhand CM Dhami lauds 4 years of governance, highlights implementation of UCC Maharashtra government removes 2289 ineligible women from Mukhyamantri Ladki Bahin scheme Landmark Land Law Reforms: CM Dhami marks 4 years of Uttarakhand government's progressive agenda From access to agency: Uplifting India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s marginalised 'Bihar ki beti': PM Modi hails ancestral ties of Trinidad and Tobago PM Kamla Persad; welcomed with Bhojpuri Chautaal Startups to giants: India rides the AI wave to sustainability Oppn backing move to oust Justice Varma, process to initiate motion to start soon: Rijiju Centre's pick & choose policy hits HC judge appointments Spy planes, minesweepers: Nod for 1 lakh crore purchases Caitlyn Jenner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s manager, Sophia Hutchins dies in tragic ATV accident at 29 CUET Result 2025 Live Updates: NTA to release scores at cuet.nta.nic.in to guide admissions at 243 universities, including DU, JNU and others IND vs ENG: Records galore as Shubman Gill joins Don Bradman, Gary Sobers in historic feat July school holidays 2025: Is 7 July a holiday for students?

We find these erroneous and egregious charges leveled against doctors \u2013 which have been repeated during the past few weeks \u2013 dismaying, disconcerting and disturbing. Hospitals and health systems are eligible to receive higher payments for complex COVID-19-related treatment under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act \u2013 that much is true. But there are several myths out there too. For months, we have been setting the record straight , and we continue to do so . Hospitals do not receive extra funds when patients die from COVID-19. They are not over-reporting COVID-19 cases. And, they are not making money on treating COVID-19. The truth is, hospitals and health systems are in their worst financial shape in decades due to COVID-19. In some cases, the situation is truly dire. An AHA report estimates total losses for our nation\u2019s hospitals and health systems of least $323 billion in 2020. There is no windfall here. Further, hospitals and health systems adhere to strict coding guidelines , and use of the COVID-19 code for Medicare claims is reserved for confirmed cases. Coding inappropriately can result in criminal penalties and exclusion from the Medicare program altogether. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , there have been as many as 299,028 more deaths this year compared to a typical year (as of Oct. 15, 2020). There have been 216,025 deaths due to COVID-19. There is no reasonable explanation for the increased deaths other than COVID-19. The professionals of America\u2019s hospitals and health systems are focused on saving lives and treating illnesses \u2013 period. They shouldn\u2019t have to waste precious time debunking theories that are offensive and untrue. The AHA stands with our physicians, nurses and front-line caregivers as they continue to battle COVID-19. As American Medical Association President Susan Bailey, M.D., said, \u201cRather than attacking us and lobbing baseless charges at physicians, our leaders should be following the science and urging adherence to the public health steps we know work \u2013 wearing a mask, washing hands and practicing physical distancing.\u201d Rick Pollack is president and CEO of the AHA.

This new virus was first identified in the city of Wuhan in the Hubei province 1 . Since then, it has spread to over 203 countries, and was officially declared as a global pandemic illness by the World Health Organization (WHO) 2 . After almost 2 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has left a toll of 446 million infected and more than 6.0 million deaths worldwide 3 . From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of facemasks (FMs) has been controversial due to political, cultural and economic causes. However, multiple studies have highlighted the efficiency of FM in the reduction of COVID-19 transmission (i.e., from 6 to 80%) 4 . In another report the use of medical/surgical masks reduced the transmission rates by 85% 5 . Countries worldwide have adapted many different approaches to control the disease 6 . Non-pharmaceutical actions included the use gowns, gloves, and FM, all of which have been proven to be effective and more recently, the use of vaccines such as the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine, Curevac, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Sino pharm has proven effective in the control of the pandemic 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 . Some side effects associated with the use of FMs have been reported. The most common side effect described by healthcare workers was bilateral headaches (affecting up to 80% of users), dermatitis, itchy rash and elevated heart rates 11 . However, the WHO has advised populations to wear FMs on a large scale only excluding patients with limited respiratory conditions 4 . Recently updated guidelines issued by the WHO advised the use of FMs as part of its prevention recommendations which also included hand hygiene, physical distance of at least 1 m, avoidance of face touching and adequate indoor ventilation 2 , 12 . Previous clinical studies have addressed the potential impact of FMs on brain and cognitive functions 13 , 14 . One study in healthy young people showed that the 150-min use of surgical mask had no significant mental fatigue perception 13 while another showed that the prolonged use of FMs can result in headache and impaired\nFact check: Experts say face masks don't cause oxygen deprivation FACT CHECK Coronavirus COVID-19 Add Topic Fact check: Experts say face masks don't cause oxygen deprivation, neurological damage Devan Patel Palm Beach Post Oct. 17, 2020 Updated Oct. 19, 2020, 12:15 p.m. ET The claim: Masks cause oxygen deprivation and neurological damage, especially in children COVID-19 has killed more than 1.1 million people worldwide, including more than 219,000 in the USA in less than a year. Despite data that masks slow the spread of the virus, skepticism exists regarding their use. Deniers vary in the reasons for their opposition. One claim that continues to surface in social media posts is that masks cause oxygen deprivation in the brain. A viral Facebook post transcribing a video message by neurologist Margareta Griesz-Brisson, which was removed by YouTube for violating its terms of service, says masks can cause neurological damage, especially in children. \u201cThe rebreathing of our exhaled air will without a doubt create oxygen deficiency and a flooding of carbon dioxide. We know that the human brain is very sensitive to oxygen deprivation. There are nerve cells, for example in the hippocampus, that can\u2019t be longer than three minutes without oxygen \u2013 they cannot survive,\u201d the post said. The Facebook user did not answer whether she fact-checked the information before creating the post. Evidence does not support that masks are dangerous Medical experts dispute claims of masks dropping oxygen to dangerous levels. \u201cWhile masks can block particles like respiratory droplets and aerosols that might contain coronavirus, they do not block gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide,\u201d said Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech and an expert in airborne disease transmission. \u201cA recent study of people wearing surgical masks while walking around found no significant changes in carbon dioxide in their breath nor oxygen in their blood, compared to walking without a mask.\u201d Jonathan Parsons, a pulmonologist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and director of the Ohio State Asthma Center, addressed those claims in a post on the medical center\u2019s website. \u201cFortunately, the flurry of complaints has also given rise to a number of highly effective demonstrations in which medical professionals display their excellent oxygen levels while trying on different masks \u2013 and sometimes multiple masks at once,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBelieve these demonstrations, because they\u2019re true.

Rating: False About this rating In September 2020, as social media users accused Netflix of promoting pedophilia due to a promotional poster for the award-winning French film \"Cuties,\" the website TorontoToday.net published an article claiming that Reed Hastings, the streaming service's CEO, had been arrested on suspicion of possession of child pornography: This is not a genuine news report. Hastings was not arrested by the FBI, and the accusations circulating on social media that the Netflix CEO was involved in child pornography are baseless and largely driven by pedophilia panic that consumed portions of the internet in 2020. Hasting is the CEO of one of the world's largest streaming services. If he truly had been arrested by the FBI, it would certainly warrant a press release from the FBI, and would undoubtedly make headlines in credible media outlets. However, the only source for this news appears to be random social media posts and an article published to a website with a history of spreading misinformation. TorontoToday.net is a relatively new website, but it has already been responsible for at least two viral hoaxes. Shortly after Black Panther actor Chadwick Boseman died from colon cancer, the website published a false report claiming that he had been poisoned. The website was also responsible for the false rumor that Russian President Vladimir Putin's daughter had died from a COVID-19 vaccine.

Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton, and Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard \u2014 over its recent release of the film \"Cuties,\" which has been criticized for sexualizing young girls. Amid the controversy, unfounded claims about Netflix CEO Reed Hastings have swirled on social media. Posts on Facebook and Instagram included a screenshot of a headline that claimed \"Netflix CEO gets BUSTED with 13,000 files of CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.\" The headline came from an article on the webpage Toronto Today. The story \u2014 which was archived on Sept. 12 prior to its removal from the site \u2014 claimed that Hastings was arrested at his home in California and faces \"11 charges related to the seizure of more than 13,000 files of graphic child pornography on his computer and various removable storage units.\" The users behind the posts did not respond to requests from USA TODAY for comment. Toronto Today denied being the original source of the false story, and noted in an email to USA TODAY that Netflix and Hastings have faced accusations of distributing child pornography since the release of \"Cuties.\" Story is false, details taken from an unrelated arrest of someone else in December 2019 The claims in the screenshots and the story from Toronto Today are false. No reputable media outlets reported the alleged arrest, and no law enforcement agencies \u2014 including the Federal Bureau of Investigations, which the article claims made the arrest \u2014 issued any press releases or statements to that effect. Numerous details in the article by Toronto Today appeared to be lifted from a report on ABC4 in December 2019, which detailed the arrest of Douglas Saltsman, a Utah CEO. Copied details include the number and content of the files, including the age of children and the nature of the sexual abuse, and evidence of a \"clandestine drug lab\" discovered during the raid.

See the sources for this fact-check If you\u2019ve been binge-watching Netflix shows to get through the lows of the coronavirus pandemic, you might have been shocked to see online claims about the alleged criminal behavior of the company\u2019s CEO. \"Kim Martin Morrow the CEO of Netflix has just been charged with 15 charges for child pornography and 31,000 files have been found on his personal computers for child porn from ages 8 and as young as toddlers,\" reads the text of a post that has been copied numerous times on different social media platforms. \"So, I think the investigation was needed. #SaveOurChildren.\" The text often accompanies a link to a story titled: \"Sen. Ted Cruz calls for a criminal investigation into Netflix film 'Cuties.'\" The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. ( Read more about our partnership with Facebook. ) Netflix\u2019s CEO has not been charged with these crimes. The claims have been debunked several times, but some social media users continue to spread the misinformation. Netflix CEO First, the claim incorrectly identifies Netflix\u2019s CEO. Reed Hastings is the CEO and co-founder of Netflix. PolitiFact searched news archives and found no evidence that Hastings had been charged with any crime. It\u2019s not clear where the name \u2018Kim Martin Morrow\u2019 originated; our searches find it solely used with these inaccurate claims. Not one of Netflix\u2019s eight senior officers or 12 directors is named Kim Martin Morrow. So why are social media users falsely linking a fake Netflix CEO to child pornography charges? That\u2019s a bit complicated. Child pornography claims The child pornography claims come after Netflix\u2019s release of the French film \u2018Cuties\u2019 was met with criticism from subscribers and other internet users.

Upon consideration, we have removed the original article from the website, and from Toronto Today-controlled Facebook and Twitter accounts. It\u2019s not worth the risk.

This fake report about the arrest of Netflix CEO Reed Hasting is just the latest in a long series of false rumors concerning pedophilia. In 2020, pedophilia panic consumed portions of the internet, in large part because these false rumors were being amplified by the growing QAnon conspiracy movement. In the last few months alone, we've covered false rumors about furniture stores trafficking children via large cabinets , department stores promoting pedophilia by selling shirts containing images of pizza , and the country of Greece classifying pedophilia as a disability. While pedophilia and sex trafficking are certainly real issues, the aforementioned stories are false. In fact, the National Human Trafficking Hotline released a statement saying that these pedophilia conspiracy theories were making it more difficult to help people who are actually in danger of being trafficked.

It began last August, when violent unrest exploded in Kenosha after a white police officer shot a Black man named Jacob Blake, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. Thousands of demonstrators turned out to protest police brutality, and some destroyed police cars, damaged businesses and burned down several buildings. On Aug. 25, the third night of protests, Rittenhouse, then 17, drove from his home in Illinois across the state line into Wisconsin, where he armed himself with an AR-15-style rifle loaded with 30 rounds.

As Trump said, how many millions die of flu?\u201d said the 56-year-old truck driver outside the early voting station in St Joseph, Missouri \u2013 a stronghold for the president.

It\u2019s what they did to me when I went to hospital for my heart beating too fast. Two weeks later I got a cold,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s political. I don\u2019t trust the US government at all. Who are they to mandate personal safety? I listen to Trump.\u201d At the end of a tumultuous week even by the standards of one of the most turbulent presidencies of modern times, the disturbing if not entirely unpredictable news that the president has contracted coronavirus prompted alarm, confusion and schadenfreude in the heart of Trumpland. St Joseph, a former frontier city where the outlaw Jesse James met his bloody end, voted overwhelmingly for the president four years ago. The polls say Missouri will go his way again next month. But with Trump struggling in key swing states, the news he has fallen sick to Covid-19 jolted an election already battered days earlier by the most undignified presidential election debate in history. 1:21 Trump mocks Biden during first presidential debate: 'I don\u2019t wear a mask like him' \u2013 video Trump\u2019s persistent interruptions and disruptions, including mocking Biden for wearing a mask in other situations,\nvirus, including visiting public gyms and touring manufacturing facilities. After the outbreak started, the White House continued to defy recommendations from scientists and health authorities to prevent or contain the virus\u2019 spread. For instance, the president\u2019s medical team declined to say when the president last tested negative for the virus. His medical team issued contradictory statements about the timeline for his diagnosis and the severity of his symptoms \u2014 at one point admitting that they misrepresented his condition to avoid causing alarm \u2014 and flouted experts\u2019 guidelines for isolation to stop the spread of the virus. The president may have also risked the health of Secret Service agents when he decided to leave the hospital to greet his supporters from his motorcade just one day after he began a steroid treatment used for patients with severe responses to Covid-19 (a decision one attending physician at Walter Reed described as \u201c insanity \u201d). Shortly after returning to the White House (and less than six days after he announced testing positive), the president met in person with aides, despite warnings from medical experts that he could have still been infectious at the time. Just two days later, Trump held an in-person rally for hundreds of supporters on the White House lawn (which, in addition to raising serious safety concerns, may have violated the Hatch Act). Since his diagnosis, the president has also continued to undermine the authority and legitimacy of federal public health agencies and experts and spread misinformation. In the midst of his intensive Covid-19 treatment, Trump urged the public, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of Covid. Don\u2019t let it dominate your life,\u201d contradicting warnings from the CDC and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease Director Dr. Anthony Fauci about the seriousness of the disease. Less than five days after first receiving an experimental drug, Trump touted it as a miracle \u201ccure,\u201d even though the drug had not completed clinical trials. He also pressured the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to make it available to the public immediately, thwarting the agency\u2019s process for ensuring the safety of new drugs and vaccines, including on an emergency basis. The president\u2019s defiance of public health guidance and downplaying of the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic in the wake of his own diagnosis are part of a long pattern of sidelining and undermining the federal government\u2019s public health apparatus. As documented below, his administration has repeatedly\nTrump's Coronavirus Case Is Leading To Conspiracy Theories Conspiracy Theories Are Everywhere About Trump\u2019s COVID-19 Diagnosis. He Helped Make Them Happen. Conspiracy theories about Trump's coronavirus case are spreading rapidly on the right and left in the vacuum of reliable information the White House has created. By by Nidhi Prakash BuzzFeed News Reporter and by Ryan Brooks BuzzFeed News Reporter Posted on October 3, 2020, 6:53 pm comment Twitter Facebook Link BuzzFeed News; Getty Images A day and a half after the president tested positive for COVID-19 , the conspiracy theories and disinformation around his condition are rampant, driven in part by his own administration\u2019s mixed messages and evasiveness about the specifics of how sick he actually is. On Saturday morning, the doctors treating him at Walter Reed Medical Center refused to answer specific, straightforward questions at a press conference about Trump\u2019s condition, like how high his fever had been, and whether he has been on oxygen since testing positive for the virus. Minutes later, an unnamed person \u201cfamiliar with the president\u2019s health\u201d told White House reporters the president\u2019s vitals had been \u201cvery concerning\u201d and \u201cthe next 48 hours will be critical in terms of his care.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re still not on a clear path to a full recovery,\u201d the source said, adding confusion to the lack of clarity about the president\u2019s condition. Online, conspiracy theorists on both the left and the right speculated that Trump had either been much sicker than we\u2019d been told \u2014 or not sick at all but rather using a fake diagnosis as part of an elaborate power play. As the US faces a moment of great uncertainty \u2014 what happens if the president is incapacitated by COVID-19? Can we rely on the negative test results of the leaders who are in line to step in? \u2014 that chaos is being amplified by the maelstrom of conspiracy theories and distrust that Trump himself has helped create. The crisis comes in the wake of four years of Trump spreading disinformation about everything from immigration to windmills. Some on the left question anything Trump says, and some on the right question anything the media says. The White House\u2019s total lack of precision isn\u2019t helping. During the press conference, the doctors also said that they were \u201c72 hours\u201d into Trump\u2019s diagnosis and that he had been administered an experimental antibody treatment \u201c48 hours ago.\u201d Shortly after the conference, the\ntweets criticism of Trump and claims to live in rural California. An archived version of the tweet can be viewed here , establishing its authenticity, and the authenticity of its date. No evidence exists to demonstrate that Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis was anything other than real, and @JohnCammo appears to have been engaging in no more than idle speculation. For one thing, Trump \"emerged\" from his illness \u2014 he returned to the White House from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center four days after his diagnosis, not 14 \u2014 and as of Oct. 6, the White House has not stated that he was treated with hydroxychloroquine. Many other Twitter users made similar predictions of Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis. As one of the most talked-about public figures alive today, and as a 74-year-old man engaging in the activities of a presidential reelection campaign, it was inevitable that at least some social media users would speculate that Trump would contract COVID-19. One demonstrably false conspiracy theory held that Trump would be falsely diagnosed with COVID-19 before the first presidential debate on Sept. 29, thus providing an excuse for him to withdraw from all three debates against Democratic opponent Joe Biden. Conversely, several supporters of Trump promoted the same false conspiracy theory about the former vice president, predicting that Biden would be \"conveniently\" stricken by the illness in order to skip the debates: The Sept. 18 tweet posted by @JohnCammo was authentic, although the specific theory advanced was either refuted or not supported by the available evidence. The prevalence of similar predictions by other social media users, about both Trump and Biden, demonstrates the ease with which social media users can engage in idle or malicious speculation, with little or no expectation of damage to reputations, even when they are proven wrong.

So what they do is they say \u2018I\u2019m sorry but everybody dies of Covid,\u2019 \u201d Trump said, without citing any evidence, at a rally in Waterford Township, Michigan. There is no evidence for the President\u2019s claim and the statement represents a stunning attack on medical workers as the country faces its worst public health emergency in more than 100 years. As of Friday evening, more than 90,000 Americans have been diagnosed with Covid-19, a new daily high, and at least 929 deaths have been reported, according to a count from Johns Hopkins University. Two states, South Dakota and Wyoming, reported their highest daily death tolls on Thursday. Medical experts have long predicted that the fall and winter would bring spikes in coronavirus cases as temperatures dropped across the country and people began spending more time indoors, where the virus can more easily spread. The country is now experiencing that spike \u2013 the five days with the most reported Covid-19 cases have all come in the last week. There is no evidence that suggests hospitals or doctors are inflating their coronavirus numbers. According to new research published this month, there were 20% more deaths from March 1 through August 1 than normally would be expected. The American Medical Association, without naming the President, condemned claims that physicians inflate the number of Covid-19 patients they treat \u2013 calling such rumors \u201cmalicious, outrageous, and completely misguided.\u201d \u201cThe suggestion that doctors \u2013 in the midst of a public health crisis \u2013 are overcounting COVID-19 patients or lying to line their pockets is a malicious, outrageous, and completely misguided charge,\u201d Dr. Susan Bailey, president of the American Medical Association, said in a written statement. \u201cThroughout this pandemic, physicians, nurses, and frontline health care workers have risked their health, their safety and their lives to treat their patients and defeat a deadly virus,\u201d Bailey added. During his campaign stop, Trump claimed that other countries attribute deaths among coronavirus patients with underlying conditions to other factors, but in the United States, doctors choose Covid-19 because they get additional funds. \u201cIn Germany and other places, if you have a heart attack, or if you have cancer, you\u2019re terminally ill, you catch Covid, they say you die of cancer, you died of heart attack.

More than one million Mexican immigrants were deported from the US in 1954. In a lengthy section of one of the longest convention speeches in memory, he blamed immigrants for crime, and said: \"We have become a dumping ground for the world, which is laughing at us, they think we're stupid.\" With reporting by Rachel Looker Republican Party US election 2024 Donald Trump US politics Joe Biden\nat a time when I was so determined to get well,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest political debate my dad and I had for months: Who should apologize to whom?\u201d The wrecked car of Neilia Biden, 1972.

A career full of personal trials has also led Biden to say, as he often did ahead of announcing his plan to seek a second term, that he is a \u201c great respecter of fate. It also helped him not only build personal relationships across the aisle but was the root of what Biden aides have long called his \u201csuperpower,\u201d his empathy. Just moments after Hunter Biden delivered his statement at the Capitol on Wednesday, Joe Biden held his first in-person meeting with family members of hostages being held by Hamas terrorists. During the two-hour meeting, which began in the East Wing and included a tour of the Oval Office, Biden shared his own history of loss, specifically raising with the families about the upcoming anniversary of the 1972 accident, according to multiple attendees. \u201cHe recounted getting the worst call a parent can receive, that his wife and three children had been in a car accident right before Christmas,\u201d Yael Alexander, the mother of 19-year-old hostage American Edan Alexander, told NBC News. \u201cThere is no question he understands the longing I feel as a mother to have my son home with me during the holidays, and the urgency with which we need a deal to bring the hostages home now.\u201d A hostage parent would later say they were able to remain composed during the emotional session until the president himself teared up. Mike Memoli Mike Memoli is an NBC News correspondent. Sarah Fitzpatrick , Monica Alba and Gary Grumbach contributed .\nis he\u2019s flat lying. But Trump wasn\u2019t lying; Biden had made statements about his climate policies that critics interpreted as voicing support for a fracking prohibition. Some of those remarks are included in a campaign video that Trump has shown at recent rallies in West Salem, Wisconsin ; Circleville, Ohio ; and Martinsburg and Lititz, Pennsylvania . And some of the edited clips in that video leave out important context. To start, in the section of the video titled \u201cBiden Will Ban Fracking,\u201d it shows CNN\u2019s Dana Bash asking Biden at a July 2019 Democratic candidates debate, \u201cWould there be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking, in a Biden administration?\u201d In the Trump video, Biden answers: \u201cNo, we would \u2014 we would work it out. We would make sure it\u2019s eliminated.\u201d \u201cJoe Biden is committed to achieving a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions by 2050,\u201d his campaign said in a statement clarifying his remarks the night of that debate. \u201cHe supports eliminating subsidies for coal and gas and deploying carbon capture sequestration technology to create economic benefits for multiple industries and significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions.\u201d Next, the video shows a clip of Biden telling an environmental activist in September 2019, \u201cI guarantee you, we\u2019re going to end fossil fuel,\u201d which includes oil and gas. Then, it transitions to a video of Biden from a March 15 debate with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \u201cNo more \u2013 no new fracking,\u201d Biden says in the clip. Not shown in Trump\u2019s video is that Biden went on to say \u201cno more drilling on federal lands,\u201d which is closer to what his energy plan says. His campaign also said that night that he only meant no new permits for oil and gas drilling on federal land and offshore. After that, the video shows Biden telling CNBC in May , \u201cI\u2019d gradually move away from fracking.\u201d But Biden was even more emphatic about not banning all fracking in that interview , in which he said: \u201cThe whole idea of whether or not we\u2019re going to stop fracking, I would not stop fracking. I\u2019d gradually move away from fracking. I would just not do more fracking on federal lands. I would gradually move us out of the position of relying on oil and gas, excuse me, and coal.\u201d That part isn\u2019t in the Trump campaign video.

Joining Voters of Tomorrow formally supporting Biden is NextGen PAC, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, Blue Future, Jr. Newtown Action Alliance, Path to Progress, Students Demand Action, Team ENOUGH, Voices of Gen-Z and Dream for America. They are doing so with more traditional, party-aligned youth organizations, the Young Democrats of America, College Democrats of America, Democratic Youth Coalition, Grassroots Dems HQ and High School Democrats of America. Monday's announcement follows similar joint endorsements the Biden campaign received last year from labor unions, environmental activists, abortion rights advocates and gun safety proponents \u2014 and some of the endorsing youth organizations are affiliated with groups that already backed the president in previously. The president's campaign said that the earlier endorsements were the first of their kind to be made jointly and so early in the cycle. Monday\u2019s announcement is coming later, but still gives young supporters eight months to mobilize behind Biden now that it\u2019s clear he\u2019ll face Trump in November. Trump and top Republicans have blasted Biden as being too old to handle a second term. A Super PAC backing the former president released an ad bluntly declaring, \u201cIf Biden wins, can he even survive till 2029?\u201d That's despite Trump making gaffes himself lately, including suggesting he's running against Barack Obama. But Aalayah Eastmond, a survivor of the 2018 Parkland school shooting in Florida and co-founder of Team ENOUGH, said Biden\u2019s age wasn\u2019t a consideration in the endorsement given that \u201cour only concern is whether we go forward or backward on one of the most pressing issues of our time.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s most important to America\u2019s youth is having a president who listens to our concerns and knows how to deliver on solutions that improve our lives,\u201d Eastmound said.

The mayor said officials will determine which churches violated the stay-at-home order on Monday, and announce fines against them later in the day. Lightfoot and Pritzker have repeatedly urged churches to find alternative ways of holding services, without allowing gatherings of more than 10 people, by holding Zoom videoconferences, or live-streaming video of services. Monday afternoon, Pritzker said he's \"extraordinarily reluctant\" to interfere with ongoing services when churches do violate the stay-at-home order, and instead wants to focus on educating faith leaders and parishioners about the need to avoid large gatherings to limit the spread of the virus. \"The job, the goal here is to keep people safe. I want people also to be able to worship. There are many ways in which to do that during this time, and I know it's very difficult,\" Pritzker said. \"So many people care deeply about the community that is their church or their mosque or their synagogue; I do too, and so we want to get back to it as soon as we can, but we have to keep each other safe, and I hope that faith leaders will heed the public health concerns, and follow the reopening plan.\" Metro Praise International Church in the Belmont Cragin neighborhood held three 45-minute services on Sunday, with dozens attending each one. The decision didn't sit well with neighbors who are following the rules, and staged a protest outside the church on Sunday. The protesters said they have had enough, and believe the church\nourselves,\" he told the crowd. \"All of us need to be in the sanctuary. I don't care what they say, I'm never again going to close the doors, ever.\" The following Sunday, church services were held. They were also held every Sunday after that.

In October 2020, the county allowed houses of worship to operate at 25% capacity. Calvary held services sometimes with attendees going well into the thousands. Months earlier, in August 2020, Santa Clara created a business compliance unit of 10 employees to investigate any violations of their COVID-19 lockdown regulations. Citizens were also encouraged to report neighbors using their website and hotline anonymously. One anonymous complaint in August 2020 saw the Church get slapped with a cease-and-desist order. From that point further, officials surveilled the Church, reported violations and wrote up fines. Every time a violation was not corrected, the fine was doubled, up to a maximum penalty of $5,000 daily. Those fines have accumulated to $2.8 million. Calvary criticized many of the methods the state used to enforce its protocols. Over at least three months, agents watched the church through a chain link fence owned by a church next door. The adjacent church had permitted the state to let law enforcement station themselves on their property. Calvary was written up for parking lot attendants' failure to wear face masks outdoors, a lack of adequate social distancing, and hugging. Officials also counted the number of cars parked outside the church on a near daily basis. According to journalist David Zweig, Santa Clara County hired SafeGraph, a company that \"aggregates information from 47 million mobile devices across the United States.\" The company's resources were allegedly used to set up a virtual perimeter around the Calvary Chapel and utilized GPS to track churchgoers.

The mayor cited a \"small number of religious communities, specific churches and specific synagogues,\u201d that are continuing to hold religious services despite a prohibition on anyone being within six feet of a person they do not live with. The restrictions were made in an attempt to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, which has infected thousands of New Yorkers and has killed over 1,000 people in the state. De Blasio warned that if these communities were found to be holding religious services, \u201cour enforcement agents will have no choice but to shut down those services.\u201d The religious congregations would also be subject to other punishments for continued defiance of the stay-at-home order, de Blasio added. This \u201cadditional action\u201d that would be taken includes fines, as well as \u201cpotentially closing the building permanently.\u201d Catholic churches in the Archdiocese of New York and the Diocese of Brooklyn, which cover all five boroughs of New York City, suspended the public celebration of Mass on March 14 and March 16, respectively.

The Justice Department sided with the church. With federal prosecutors now weighing in, the national debate over how far coronavirus gathering limits can go to restrict religion could get even louder. President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection appeal to devout conservative voters rests in part on his vocal advocacy for religious freedom, making the issue a politically potent one for his administration to take up. The Kansas Supreme Court upheld Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly\u2019s move to limit faith gatherings to 10 people, while a federal judge in Kentucky sided with a church that challenged the Louisville mayor\u2019s restrictions on drive-in Easter services. The church has been in Greenville for more than 65 years. Scott said his congregants, about 125 in all, are mostly older and on fixed incomes, and aren\u2019t tech-savvy, so the radio broadcast was a way to keep them connected. Greenville Mayor Errick D. Simmons, a Democrat, said Monday that no one will have to pay the fines, but the ban on such gatherings remains in place to try to save lives as the highly contagious virus continues to spread. He also called on Republican Gov. Tate Reeves to issue clear statewide guidance on whether people are allowed to congregate for worship during the governor\u2019s statewide stay-at-home order that remains in effect until April 20. The governor\u2019s order tells people not to gather in groups of 10 or more. Reeves has said he would prefer that churches not hold services in sanctuaries or parking lots. But he has also said the government does not have the right to ban worship. On Tuesday, he tweeted a thanks to Attorney General William Barr \u201cfor this strong stand in support of religious liberty. The government cannot shut down churches.\u201d Attorney Ryan Tucker of the Alliance Defending Freedom, which represents the church, says there\u2019s a Sonic Drive-In restaurant about 200 yards (180 meters) from the church where patrons are still allowed to roll down their windows and talk. He said they will continue the lawsuit seeking a restraining order because the mayor\u2019s order remains in place. \u201cThe threat is still present,\u201d he said. \u201cThey mayor did not say he\u2019s rescinding the order.\u201d There are at least 3,000 cases of coronavirus in Mississippi and more"}], "source": "rag_only"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 5, "concluded_by_rag": true, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.6}

The report expressed concern for many of the children who have been excluded from school education during the Covid-19 pandemic and voiced fear that they may not be able to return to schools again. \"Even if they do, a large number of children would not find a level playing field anymore,\" it said. The CRY report also dwelt on the pandemic-triggered disruption in school meal services affecting the nutrition of 6-17 years children. \"As schools are closed across the country, the school feeding programme could no longer provide the much-needed free lunch to 115.9 million children who are enrolled under the Mid-Day Meal (MDM) scheme. To cater to the hunger of millions of children who depend on MDM as their source of only nutrition, government needs to devise newer\nhas been claimed that since the lockdown imposed by PM Modi to curb the spread of coronavirus in the country has adversely affected the education of students, the government is helping students by providing them free smartphones. The post also claimed that since schools and colleges are closed since the last week of March, the government is giving smartphones to all students in order to help them attend online classes and complete their studies.

STRAIN IN RELATIONS Relations between Moscow and Washington have been strained in recent year s by everything from Syria to Ukraine to U.S. election interference, something Russia denies. Trump spent two years battling a federal investigation into whether his 2016 campaign colluded with Russia. \"Nothing to see here. Just a Russian military aircraft landing at JFK with 60 tons of medical supplies to support America\u2019s #COVID19 response. A propaganda bonanza as our own government shrinks from America\u2019s leadership role in a global crisis,\" said Brett McGurk, a former American diplomat for Trump and former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush. Trump said on Tuesday he and Putin discussed the virus at length. \"Russia is being hit pretty hard,\" he said. Peskov, Putin's spokesman, said Moscow hoped the United States might also be able to provide medical help to Russia if necessary when the time came. \"It is important to note that when offering assistance to U.S. colleagues, the president (Putin) assumes that when U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials gain momentum, they will also be able to reciprocate if necessary,\" Peskov was cited as saying. Peskov complained that some U.S. officials had made it needlessly difficult to expedite the aid. He also was quoted as saying that Russia and China cooperated in a similar way because \"at a time when the current situation affects everyone without exception ... there is no alternative to working together in a spirit of partnership and mutual assistance.\" Russia has also used its military to send planeloads of aid to Italy to combat the spread of the coronavirus, exposing the European Union's failure to provide swift help to a member in crisis and handing Putin a publicity coup at home and abroad.

Since 2020, an average of one baby every month in New Zealand has survived an attempted abortion\u2014yet is denied life-sustaining care. Official government data obtained under the nation\u2019s Official Information Act reveal that approximately 80 such infants were born alive after abortion attempts between 2020 and 2025, at gestations ranging from 20 to 30 weeks. Even more alarming are the policies behind those numbers. Some health districts only consider resuscitation for \u201cwanted babies\u201d after 22 weeks and 5 days, while others defer to parental discretion on whether the child should be treated at all. Family First reports that in one district, the practice has been to \u201cwrap the baby in a blanket and hold it until it passes.\u201d These cases are not isolated tragedies\u2014they mirror a global pattern of failed abortions and infants left without protection . As documented on abortionsurvivors.org , data from around the world show similar outcomes. A 2024 peer-reviewed study in Swiss Medical Weekly analyzing Canadian health data found that among 13,777 second-trimester terminations (15\u201329 weeks), 11.2 percent resulted in live births \u2014a rate that rose sharply with gestational age. Another 2025 analysis published in JAMA revealed that survival rates for infants born at 22 weeks who receive active treatment have climbed from 25.7 percent in 2014 to 41 percent in 2023. These findings confirm what many clinicians and survivors already know: viability is increasing, and the line between \u201cabortion\u201d and \u201cinfanticide\u201d grows thinner with every year that care is withheld. Despite that reality, a 2020 amendment to New Zealand\u2019s abortion law\u2014which would have required life-sustaining treatment for babies born alive\u2014was rejected by nearly two-thirds of MPs. \u201cThis is not about politics\u2014it\u2019s about having a heart,\u201d said Family First NZ CEO Bob McCoskrie. He called for new legislation that mandates equal medical care for all newborns, regardless of the circumstances of birth. At The Abortion Survivors Network , we know these\nrejected by nearly two-thirds of MPs. \u201cThis is not about politics\u2014it\u2019s about having a heart,\u201d said Family First NZ CEO Bob McCoskrie. He called for new legislation that mandates equal medical care for all newborns, regardless of the circumstances of birth. At The Abortion Survivors Network , we know these children exist\u2014because we serve them. Their stories, and those of their mothers, testify that life can and does survive abortion . What happens next is up to us: will governments and medical professionals acknowledge these lives as worthy of protection, or continue to look away? The New Zealand findings join a growing body of international evidence demanding transparency, compassion, and accountability.

[ 6 ] Worker and traveler mandates Private mandates As of July 2021, vaccination mandates have largely been enforced by means of employers, including private businesses and governmental divisions, [ 7 ] [ 8 ] while some private businesses such as restaurants and event promoters may also decline to serve customers if they do not present proof of vaccination . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] In August 2021, several cities announced plans to require proof of vaccination for patrons of certain types of non-essential indoor venues. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] In some cases, provisions that are described as a vaccine mandate are officially termed as a constraint requiring those who are not fully-vaccinated for COVID-19 to undergo regular testing\u2014thus allowing for medical or religious exemptions to be fulfilled when needed. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] In June 2021, the initial EUA status of the vaccines led to challenges as to whether such mandates were legal, [ 17 ] as FDA regulations state that a person must be informed \"of the option to accept or refuse administration of the product, of the consequences, if any, of refusing administration of the product, and of the alternatives to the product that are available and of their benefits and risks\". As these regulations refer to an \"option to accept or refuse\", some opponents of vaccination initially questioned whether a vaccine issued under EUA can be mandated as a vaccination policy . [ 18 ] [ 19 ] However, courts addressing the issue uniformly held that such mandates were permissible, with the court in Klaassen v. Indiana University in particular addressing this subject at length.

Along with his mother and siblings, he was in the 1972 crash, sustaining injuries to his skull. Along with his older brother, he survived after receiving months of medical treatment. Like his father and brother, Hunter attended Archmere Academy in Claymont, Delaware . He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Georgetown University in 1992. During the year after he graduated from college, he served as a Jesuit volunteer at a church in Portland, Oregon , and met Kathleen Buhle , whom he married in 1993. After attending Georgetown University Law Center for one year, he transferred to Yale Law School and graduated in 1996. [ 33 ] He and Kathleen divorced in 2017 and, in 2019, he married Melissa Cohen. After law school, Hunter accepted a position at bank holding company MBNA America, a major contributor to his father's political campaigns. By 1998, Biden had risen to the rank of executive vice president. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] During the 2020 election , the Trump administration pointed out that Hunter Biden had connections with the Ukrainian holding company Burisma .

AP file But Beau Biden\u2019s passing only reignited addiction challenges Hunter Biden had faced before. In his 2021 memoir, Hunter said he felt the unresolved trauma both he and his brother dealt with after the accident in 1972 \u201cmanifested themselves differently in each of us,\u201d for the rest of their lives. To blame it for his own substance abuse battles would be a \u201ccop-out,\u201d he wrote, but added later that it took him decades \u201cto acknowledge that original loss, address that original trauma, recognize that original pain.\u201d Reflecting on grief recently in an interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, Joe Biden said that as difficult as losing Beau was for him, it \u201cwas even more profound for Hunter\u201d and his daughter, Ashley. \u201cIt made me a little more fatalistic. It also caused me and Jill enormous pain because he should be the one sitting there talking to you, Beau. He was a better man than I am, and so is Hunter,\u201d Joe Biden said. Hunter, in his book, wrote that he and his father initially \u201cdealt with our grief in ways that often were incongruent with helping each other.\u201d His father immersed himself in his work, as vice president and then in the run-up to his 2020 campaign, but ultimately the attacks on him in that campaign helped bring them together again. \u201cWhenever I apologized to him for bringing so much heat onto his campaign, he responded by saying how sorry he was for putting me on the spot, for bringing so much heat onto me, especially at a time when I was so determined to get well,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest political debate my dad and I had for months: Who should apologize to whom?\u201d The wrecked car of Neilia Biden, 1972.

They say his achievements matter more than his age POLITICS Youth activist groups jointly endorse Biden. They say his achievements matter more than his age Will Weissert Associated Press March 11, 2024, 8:12 a.m. ET View Comments Washington \u2014 Jack Lobel is a college sophomore who will be voting in his first presidential election this fall, casting a ballot for Joe Biden. At 19, he's six-plus decades Biden's junior, which isn't lost on him. But Lobel is spokesperson for Voters of Tomorrow, one of 15 youth organizations that announced Monday that they are jointly endorsing the reelection of the oldest president in U.S. history \u2014 defying polls consistently showing voter concerns about the 81-year-old Biden's age. \u201cIf age were really a concern we would not see this much energy around these groups,\" said Lobel, an urban studies major in New York. As he worked on hammering out the joint endorsement this week he was also writing a paper for his American urban politics class and taking a midterm in his voting and political behavior class. \u201cPresident Biden comes before midterms and exams and papers,\u201d Lobel said, only half-joking. The joint endorsement is meant as a show of political strength for Biden, who would be 86 by the end of the second term he's seeking \u2014 after Super Tuesday all but cemented a November rematch of the 2020 election between him and former President Donald Trump. The groups' affinity for the president is little surprise given that young people tend to be more left-leaning than many other voting blocs. Still, it may soften the blow of many voters' concerns about Biden's age. A recent Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey found that 63% of Americans believe Biden lacks mental capability to serve effectively as president, though 57% felt similar about Trump, who is 77. In the first ad of a $30-million, post-Super-Tuesday, swing-state advertising blitz, Biden makes no excuses for his age, but says he's been more effective as president than Trump was. \u201cYoung voters are critical to President Biden\u2019s winning coalition and together, we will defeat Donald Trump and continue to build a future that works for every single American,\" said Biden's reelection campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, in a statement first shared with The Associated Press. Joining Voters of Tomorrow formally supporting Biden is NextGen PAC, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, Blue\naddiction, and blasted Republicans who he said \u201chave taken the light of my dad\u2019s love for me and presented it as darkness.\u201d Hunter Biden has also said Republicans are weaponizing the president\u2019s love for him to distract him in the campaign. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to kill me knowing it will be a pain greater than my father could be able to handle,\u201d he said in a podcast interview with the recording artist Moby.

Hunter Biden \u201ccomes up all the time,\u201d one source who has spoken with the president said, sometimes out of concern but also with pride at how he has endured the harsh spotlight recently. Not everyone in the West Wing, even at senior levels, knew what Hunter Biden would say Wednesday. But the president, who speaks with his son most days, if not multiple times each day, knew. And sources close to the president quickly praised the remarks as \u201cpowerful\u201d and \u201cforceful.\u201d Republicans have made \u201cwhere\u2019s Hunter\u201d a calling card of the 2024 race, with merchandise bearing the slogan. Biden advisers have noted, though, that Hunter Biden was also a target in the 2020 race and said the president\u2019s critics often miss that the president\u2019s standing by his son, especially supporting him in his recovery, has often made those attacks backfire.

Two officers were inadvertently shot by other law enforcement personnel. One officer was killed while responding to a burglary; one was killed during a tactical situation and one was killed while responding to a call for an armed suicidal suspect. Handguns were the leading type of firearm used against law enforcement in 2018. Of the 52 officer fatalities, 31 officers were shot and killed with a handgun; four were disarmed and shot with their own duty weapons. Traffic-related fatalities increased nine percent from 2017 with 50 officer deaths. Of those, 32 officers were killed in crashes.

The country\u2019s journey into nationhood was herald by high hopes and prospects for national unity, peace and development. This was because of its vast human and material resources, and land mass. Nigeria is dominantly made of three prominent regions: the North (Hausa Fulani), the West (Yorubas) and the East (Igbos) with minorities in other regions. The military took over the leadership of the country barely six years into her independence as a nation. The military held sway for twenty nine years out of the ininitial forty years of the country\u2019s post independence history before her return to civil rule in 1999. The county is still been confronted with challenges on all fronts ranging from insecurity and insurgency, economy, political uncertainty, electoral malpractices, high rate of unemployment, poor infrastructure amongst others. Literature have been skewed toward military intervention in politics as the root cause of the challenges bedeviling the country more than two decades after her return to civil rule. The study employed both quantitative and qualitative data. The study analysed the history of military rule in Nigeria and interrogated the crux of the military institution. It further analysed the peculiarities of each of the military regimes. The study also examined the post-military era in the country and concluded with recommendations.\nMilitary dictatorship in Nigeria - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Nigerian military reign from 1966\u20131999 Federal Republic of Nigeria (1966; 1966\u20131979; 1983\u20131993; 1993\u20131999) Republic of Nigeria note (1966) 1966\u20131979 1983\u20131993 1993\u20131999 Flag Coat of arms Motto: \"Peace, Unity, Freedom\" [ 1 ] (1966\u20131978) \"Unity and Faith, Peace and Progress\" [ 1 ] (1978\u20131979; 1983\u20131993; 1993\u20131999) Anthem: Nigeria, We Hail Thee [ 1 ] (1966\u20131978) Arise, O Compatriots [ 1 ] (1978\u20131979; 1983\u20131993; 1993\u20131999) Capital Lagos (1966\u20131979; 1983\u20131991) Abuja (1991\u20131993; 1993\u20131999) Largest city Lagos Common languages English Hausa Igbo Yoruba and other regional languages Religion Christianity Islam Traditional beliefs Government Federal presidential republic under military dictatorship (January\u2013May 1966; 1966\u20131979; 1983\u20131993; 1993\u20131999) [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Unitary presidential republic under military dictatorship (24 May 1966 \u2013 31 August 1966) Head of State / President \u2022 1966 Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi b \u2022 1966\u20131975 Yakubu Gowon \u2022 1975\u20131976 Murtala Mohammed \u2022 1976\u20131979 Olusegun Obasanjo \u2022 1983\u20131985 Muhammadu Buhari \u2022 1985\u20131993 Ibrahim Babangida \u2022 1993\u20131998 Sani Abacha \u2022 1998\u20131999 Abdulsalami Abubakar c Chief of Staff / Vice President \u2022 1966 Babafemi Ogundipe (first) \u2022 1998\u20131999 Mike Akhigbe (last) Legislature None ( rule by decree ) Historical era Cold War \u2022 Established 15 January 1966 \u2022 Unification Decree [ 2 ] 24 May 1966 \u2022 1966 Nigerian counter-coup 28 July 1966 \u2022 Federal system restored [ 3 ] 31 August 1966 \u2022 Biafra secession d 30 May 1967 \u2022 1975 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat 29 July 1975 \u2022 1976 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt 13 February 1976 \u2022 Second Republic 1 October 1979 \u2022 1983 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat 31 December 1983 \u2022 1985 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat 27 August 1985 \u2022 1993 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat 17 November 1993 \u2022 Fourth Republic 29 May 1999 Area 1991 [ 4 ] 923,768 km 2 (356,669 sq mi) Population \u2022 1991 [ 4 ] 88,514,501 Currency Nigerian pound (1966\u20131973) Naira (\u20a6) (1973\u20131979; 1983\u20131993; 1993\u20131999) Time zone UTC +1 ( WAT ) ISO 3166 code NG Preceded by Succeeded by First Nigerian Republic Second Nigerian Republic Second Nigerian Republic Third Nigerian Republic Fourth Nigerian Republic Today part of Nigeria Cameroon e ^a Formal name of the country from 24 May to 31 August 1966.

While it is true that colonizers played a significant role in the decline of bison populations, the specific number of twenty-seven is not supported by historical data.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the historical context and the known population figures, the claim that the number of North American bison was reduced to only twenty-seven individuals is false.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 0, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.6}
{"claim": "U.S. President Donald Trump has suspended all travel from China.", "label": "Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking", "result": {"response": "To assess the factual accuracy of the statement \"U.S. President Donald Trump has suspended all travel from China,\" we need to analyze the relevant knowledge points provided.\n\n1. **Travel Restrictions**: The knowledge indicates that Trump did not completely \"lock down\" travel from China. There were exemptions for American citizens, permanent residents, and their family members. This means that while there were restrictions in place, not all travel was suspended.\n\n2. **Exemptions**: The knowledge specifies that only foreign nationals who had been in China, the Schengen area, the UK, or Ireland within the past 14 days were outright banned from entering the U.S. This implies that travel was not entirely suspended, as citizens and certain other groups could still enter.\n\n3. **Misrepresentation of Actions**: The knowledge points out that Trump often describes the travel restrictions as a \"ban\" without elaborating on the exemptions, which misrepresents the full scope of the restrictions.\n\nBased on these points, the statement that Trump has \"suspended all travel from China\" is misleading because it does not account for the exemptions that allowed many individuals to still travel from China to the U.S.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the statement is **False**.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "China contained exemptions for certain people \u2013 he usually just describes it as a \u201cban\u201d without elaboration \u2013 he still wasn\u2019t telling the full story.

You can read more about the Trump administration\u2019s travel restrictions in response to coronavirus here . Biden and the restrictions on China During the meeting with DeSantis, Trump repeated his false claim that Biden had apologized for previous criticism of Trump\u2019s travel restrictions on China. \u201cHe said all sorts of things, we won\u2019t even say it. And then he apologized because \u2013 two weeks ago he put out a statement that I was right,\u201d Trump said . Facts First: Biden\u2019s campaign announced in early April that he supports Trump\u2019s travel restrictions on China, so part of Trump\u2019s claim is correct. But neither Biden nor his campaign apologized for any previous criticism of Trump. The campaign says that the Biden comments Trump has described as criticism of the China restrictions \u2013 in which Biden said Trump has a record of \u201chysterical xenophobia\u201d and \u201cfear mongering\u201d \u2013 were not about the travel restrictions at all. The campaign says Biden did not know about the China restrictions at the time of the January 31 speech in which he made these remarks, since his campaign event in Iowa started shortly after the briefing during which the China restrictions were revealed by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. Given the timing of the Biden remarks, it\u2019s not unreasonable for the Trump campaign to infer that Biden was talking about the travel restrictions. But Biden never took an explicit position on the restrictions until his April declaration of support \u2013 and whether or not you accept his campaign\u2019s argument that the \u201cxenophobia\u201d claim was not about the restrictions, he certainly hasn\u2019t apologized.

Nobody acted fast like I did.\u201d There are several false claims in this statement. For starters, as we have written repeatedly, Trump did not \u201clock down\u201d travel from China. There were exceptions for American citizens and permanent residents, as well as their family members, meaning that tens of thousands of people flew directly from China to the U.S. in the months after the restrictions were enacted. As for Biden, the former vice president made this statement on the same day that the president announced the travel restrictions on Jan. 31: \u201cThis is no time for Donald Trump\u2019s record of hysteria, xenophobia \u2013 hysterical xenophobia \u2013 and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.\u201d Trump cites it as evidence that Biden opposed his decision to impose travel restrictions on China. But the Biden campaign on April 3 said Biden supported the travel restrictions, and that the xenophobia comment was unrelated to them. And finally, contrary to Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cnobody acted fast like I did\u201d with travel restrictions on China, a country-by-country analysis by Think Global Health, a project of the Council on Foreign Relations, shows that 36 countries imposed travel restrictions, including the U.S., by Feb. 2. #4: Face Masks Trump misstated the findings of a study on COVID-19, saying, \u201cDid you see, the CDC? That 85% of the people wearing the mask catch it, okay?\u201d The day before the speech, the CDC released a tweet directly contradicting the president\u2019s claim, saying, \u201cthe interpretation that more mask-wearers are getting infected compared to non-mask wearers is incorrect.\u201d The major finding of the CDC study , released Sept. 11, was that people in the survey with COVID-19 were twice as likely to have eaten at a restaurant, and that eating in restaurants or drinking in bars might be a higher risk activity. The report also found that people in the study with and without COVID-19 reported high levels of mask wearing in public. Among the approximately 150 COVID-19 patients in the study, 85% reported they \u201calways\u201d or \u201coften\u201d wore a face mask in the 14 days before illness onset. The CDC tweeted on Oct. 14, \u201cMuch evidence shows wearing masks in public reduces transmission by blocking exhaled respiratory droplets.\u201d #5: Fauci\u2019s Not a Democrat Trump wrongly said of Fauci, \u201cHe\u2019s a Democrat, everybody knows that.\u201d The longtime NIAID director\nwarning of human-to-human transmission and transmissibility higher than seasonal flu. Konyndyk, now a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, wrote on Twitter: \u201cSo to pin the blame on WHO for this, you have to believe that somehow those 9 days between 14 and 23 January were critical to the lack of US preparedness. It\u2019s lunacy. The administration spent the whole month of February doing nothing to meaningfully prepare the homeland.\u201d View image in fullscreen Donald Trump departs after speaking in the Rose Garden. Photograph: Alex Brandon/AP On Tuesday, Trump complained that the WHO \u201cdefended the actions of the Chinese government, even praising its so-called transparency\u201d. Yet on 24 January, Trump tweeted: \u201cChina has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus . The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!\u201d And on 7 February, by which time the WHO had declared a public health emergency, Trump was asked if China was engaged in a cover up. \u201cNo, China\u2019s working very hard ... and I think they\u2019re doing a very professional job. They\u2019re in touch with World Health.\u201d And even by 27 February, despite multiple warnings from the intelligence agencies and his own advisers, he was still minimising the virus, stating: \u201cIt\u2019s going to disappear. One day \u2013 it\u2019s like a miracle \u2013 it will disappear.\u201d By the end of the month, the US had only conducted around 4,000 tests for coronavirus while other countries tested tens of thousands of people. Leslie Dach, the chair of the pressure group Protect Our Care, said of the WHO defunding: \u201cThis is nothing more than a transparent attempt by President Trump to distract from his history downplaying the severity of the coronavirus crisis and his administration\u2019s failure to prepare our nation. Dach, who served as the global Ebola coordinator for the health department, added: \u201cTo be sure, the World Health Organization is not without fault but it is beyond irresponsible to cut its funding at the height of a global pandemic. This move will undoubtedly make Americans less safe.\u201d At Tuesday\u2019s briefing, Trump backed away from his Monday claim of \u201ctotal\u201d authority over states, a remark that prompted Andrew Cuomo, the New York governor, to note that Trump is not a king. \u201cI will be speaking to all 50 governors very\nisn\u2019t to stop it, but to slow it Coronavirus live updates from February 5 Opinion: A love letter to Wuhan, from a heartbroken local watching from abroad Analysis: China says Xi Jinping is directing its Wuhan coronavirus response, but he\u2019s nowhere to be seen Report that said Wuhan coronavirus can spread before symptoms was flawed Two cruise ships quarantined in Asia amid coronavirus outbreak, stranding more than 5,000 Disney could take a $280 million hit from its Chinese parks because of the coronavirus and protests SARS cost global airlines $7 billion.

But Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg last week said Conservatives did not need to do so because they knew each other well, and this meant they were complying with government guidance. And he claimed Labour MPs only wore masks when the television cameras were around. The latest official guidance says people in England should cover their faces around \"people you don't normally meet\". It comes as the World Health Organisation (WHO) urged MPs to wear masks during Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget speech, when there is likely to be standing room only in the Commons chamber. Dr David Nabarro, the WHO's special envoy for Covid-19, told Sky News that \"everybody\" should be wearing masks in close confinement with other people, \"including our leaders\". \"This virus, it is absolutely unstoppable, it gets everywhere, and so we have to do everything we possibly can to stop it. \"And one of the best ways to stop it is a well-fitting surgical mask properly over your face, pushed in over your nose, covering everything, and that reduces the risk to others and the risk to you. \"If it works, why on earth don't people use it? It's not a party political issue - this virus doesn't vote.\" Garry Graham, deputy general secretary of the union Prospect, said the public looked to MPs to set an example. \"It's welcome that House authorities are finally catching on to what unions have been saying, that it's too early to relax. But we're still left in the ludicrous situation where MPs do as they please on masks while everyone else does the right thing,\" he said. \"Continuously changing an already inconsistent message is a recipe for non-compliance and increased risk to everyone.\" House of Commons Chancellor's Autumn Statement Personal protective equipment (PPE)\nCovid: Masks mandatory for everyone in the Commons - except MPs Skip to content Home News US & Canada UK UK Politics England N.

In updated guidance, the Commons authorities said all staff, visitors, contractors and press must cover their faces to combat the spread of Covid. But it remains up to individual MPs to decide whether to follow suit - and many Conservatives have chosen not to. Sajid Javid has said he will wear a mask for Wednesday's Budget when the chamber will be packed. But the health secretary said on Monday it was a \"personal decision\" for ministers and backbenchers as to whether they did too. Tories are friends so don't need masks - Rees-Mogg Where are masks still compulsory in the UK? MPs are not employed by the Commons authorities and cannot be forced to wear masks. They have been encouraged to do so by Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle - but unions representing Parliamentary workers have urged him to take a tougher line .

The income estimates in the main sections of this report are based on the concept of money income, which is pretax and does not account for the value of in-kind transfers. Appendix A provides a detailed explanation of how income is measured using the CPS ASEC. Estimates of post-tax income and inequality are included in Appendix B. Income in the United States: 2023 [<1.0 MB] Highlights Real median household income was $80,610 in 2023, a 4.0 percent increase from the 2022 estimate of $77,540 (Figure 1 and Table A-1). This is the first statistically significant annual increase in real median household income since 2019. Real median household incomes increased by 5.4 percent for White households and by 5.7 percent for non-Hispanic White households between 2022 and 2023. There was no significant change in median incomes for Black, Asian, and Hispanic households (Figure 2 and Table A-1). Household income rose throughout the income distribution, increasing 6.7 percent at the 10th percentile and 4.6 percent at the 90th percentile (Table A-3). Income inequality as measured by the Gini index and income percentile ratios was not significantly different between 2022 and 2023 (Figure 3 and Table A-3). Between 2022 and 2023, the number of total workers increased by 2.2 million, or 1.3 percent. The change in the number of full-time, year-round workers was not statistically significant (Figure 5 and Table A-6). Real median earnings for men who worked full-time, year-round increased by 3.0 percent, and real median earnings increased 1.5 percent for women who worked full-time, year-round (Figure 4 and Table A-6). For full-time, year-round workers, the female-to-male earnings ratio in 2023 fell to 82.7 percent from 84.0 percent in 2022 (Figure 6 and Table A-6). This is the first statistically significant annual decrease in the female-to-male earnings ratio since 2003. Tables Income: Table A-1.

Here are a few lessons the average person can take away from it. Henglein and Steets / Getty Images Building Wealth Takes Time First, consider how long it took for Biden to become a millionaire. He began his career in 1968 and likely didn\u2019t reach millionaire status for two decades. It\u2019s a good reminder that building a fortune takes time. Instead of trying to get rich quickly, you\u2019re often better off taking the methodical route. Practically, that means consistently spending less than you earn and allocating savings to smart investments. The most realistic path to wealth for the majority of people is investing in the S&P 500, according to financial experts like Warren Buffet and Mark Cuban . It returns an average of around 10.26% . That can add up to quite a bit throughout your life. For example, say you invest $20,000 into the S&P today. Then, you continue investing $1,000 monthly for the next 30 years. You\u2019d end up with over $2.5 million from just $360,000 in contributions. This shows how time creates wealth when you invest well. SrdjanPav / iStock.com The Power of Resiliency Biden\u2019s story is also a good lesson in the power of resiliency. He\u2019s experienced some of the highest highs that a person can because he never gave up during his lowest lows.

But three kinds of evidence point to more than 350,000 deaths* By Christie Aschwanden edited by Josh Fischman Peter Horvath * Editor's Note (1/3/21): The number of COVID deaths in the U.S. is now more than 350,000, as of the beginning of January, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center . A persistent falsehood has been circulating on social media: the number of COVID deaths is much lower than official statistics, and therefore the danger of the disease has been overblown. In August, President Donald Trump retweeted a post claiming that only 6 percent of these reported deaths were actually from COVID-19. (The tweet originated from a follower of the debunked conspiracy fantasy QAnon.) Twitter removed the post for containing false information, but fabrications such as these continue to spread. In September outgoing U.S. Representative Roger Marshall of Kansas\u2014now incoming senator\u2014 complained that Facebook had removed a post in which he claimed that 94 percent of COVID-19 deaths reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u201cwere the result of 2-3 additional serious illnesses and were of advanced age.\u201d Now some facts: Researchers know beyond a doubt that the number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. surpassed a quarter of a million people by November 2020. This number is supported by three lines of evidence, including death certificates. The inaccurate idea that only 6 percent of the deaths were really caused by the coronavirus is \u201ca gross misinterpretation\u201d of how death certificates work, says Robert Anderson, chief mortality statistician at the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.

COVID-19 has killed over 5 million people worldwide in just 2 years. But how do flu and COVID-19 deaths compare in the United States? On average in the United States, as shown in the graph below, people are less like to die from the flu than COVID-19. In this graph , you can see the difference in flu and COVID-19 mortality rates from 2014 to December 2021: COVID-19 Prevention is Also Flu Prevention It\u2019s important to note that when COVID-19 started spreading and the country went on lockdown in March 2020, the same measures that were used to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d stopped the flu entirely. In fact, the CDC stopped tracking flu activity early for the 2019-2020 season because COVID-19 precautions wiped out the flu. The flu was virtually nonexistent for the 2020-2021 season likely because people were wearing masks, staying home more often, and not socializing. Now that flu and COVID-19 are spreading at the same time, flu deaths may sadly rise again. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to get vaccinated, get tested, and wear masks to prevent both viruses. Flu is Still Serious Just because flu mortality is lower than COVID-19 mortality doesn\u2019t mean flu isn\u2019t serious. CDC estimates that flu has resulted in 9 million \u2013 41 million illnesses, 140,000 \u2013 710,000 hospitalizations, and 12,000 \u2013 52,000 deaths annually between 2010 and 2020.

The Tax Foundation estimated BBBA would raise $1.7 trillion of gross revenue over the next decade: $470 billion from corporate and international tax changes; $516 billion from individual tax changes (excluding changes to the State and Local Tax deduction A tax deduction allows taxpayers to subtract certain deductible expenses and other items to reduce how much of their income is taxed, which reduces how much tax they owe.

Altogether, President Biden is proposing raising revenue by more than $4 trillion primarily from new taxes on U.S. businesses and individuals, exceeding the magnitude of his proposed tax hikes during the 2020 campaign ($3.7 trillion on a gross basis). The gross tax increase would be reduced on a net basis by increases in tax credit s for certain individuals and economic activities.

The budget proposes several new tax increases on high-income individuals and businesses, which combined with the\ncapital gains and dividends. However, all of these tax increases would be limited to households making over $400,000, which is only around 1.5 percent of total households. Biden proposes another $1.8 trillion of taxes on corporations, under our central estimate . Most economists and estimators believe corporate tax burdens are borne by some combination of shareholders, owners of capital, and workers. Since many middle-class households include both workers and shareholders (through pensions and retirement accounts, for example), any increase in corporate taxes would indirectly increase their tax burden, albeit modestly. Based on analyses and estimates of Biden's tax plan published by the Tax Policy Center , Penn Wharton Budget Model , Tax Foundation , and American Enterprise Institute , tax burdens among the bottom 80 percent of households in the income distribution would see a 0.2 to 0.6 percent reduction in after-tax income. For a typical family in the middle of the income distribution, this amounts to $180 to $260 per year. But again, these are indirect tax increases. And they don't include many of the tax cuts proposed by Vice President Biden, which will more than offset the increase for many households. It is important to note that Biden's plans, as we've estimated in The Cost of the Trump and Biden Campaign Plans , fall $5.6 trillion short of being offset. Covering this cost may in fact require new taxes on a broader swath of Americans. But as of now, only a small share of Americans would face a tax increase under Biden's plans.

Impose a 20 percent minimum tax on \u201cbillionaires\u201d: $360.8 billion tax increase This tax, called a \u201cbillionaire minimum income tax,\u201d would impose an annual 20 percent tax on taxpayers with income and assets that exceeding $100 million, a $360 billion tax increase. This tax is just the latest attempt by the Democrats to reshape the tax code and pass a tax on unrealized gains. This new tax is similar to the wealth taxes pushed by radical progressives such as Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). It would create a \u201cmark to market\u201d regime that would force Americans to pay taxes every year on the paper gain in the value of assets (i.e. stocks, collectibles, real estate). Currently, taxpayers only pay the capital gains tax when an asset is sold. This makes sense because the asset is illiquid until it is disposed of. This tax on unrealized gains would create a new tax system that requires taxpayers to pay tax on the value of an asset based on the value of these assets on a particular arbitrary date. It would empower the IRS, encourage taxpayers to move assets overseas, and could grow to hit millions of Americans over time. It would also harm the economy, impose retroactive taxation, and has failed everywhere it has been tried before. 5.

Some of the proposals may be familiar, recycled from prior budgets and failed legislative attempts , but some are new, like the proposed tax hikes for Medicare funding . In total, they would add up to almost $4.7 trillion in new taxes targeted at businesses and high-income individuals. The major changes include higher marginal tax rates on corporate, individual, and capital gains income; a complicated new minimum tax on high-net-worth individuals; and increases to Medicare taxes. The negative effects of higher tax rates on saving, investment, and entrepreneurship would have economy-wide repercussions , ultimately harming workers, international competitiveness, and domestic investment. The Biden budget would also expand and create several tax credits, including a three-year extension of the American Rescue Plan Act Child Tax Credit (CTC) through 2025 and a permanent expansion of CTC refundability. The tax credits would offset the $4.7 trillion in gross taxes by about $900 billion, resulting in $3.8 trillion of net tax increases. After about $1 trillion of additional new spending on top of expanded tax credits, the FY2024 Budget would reduce the deficit by $2.8 trillion over the next decade. The Biden budget pays lip service to continuing at least some of the individual income tax cuts included in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) that will expire after 2025, but offers no concrete proposal for doing so. As such, the cost of TCJA extensions is not factored into the budget. Nor is the cost of continuing the temporary expansion of the CTC. Together, such extensions would likely offset the projected deficit reductions.

Show More Influenza outlook CDC expects that the severity of the 2025-2026 influenza season will most likely be classified as moderate across all ages, with low confidence , based on historical trends, expert opinion, and recent surveillance data trends. Our confidence in this assessment is low, downgraded from moderate confidence in our initial influenza outlook, due to uncertainties in the potential impact of circulating influenza viruses on U.S. population immunity and vaccine effectiveness. As of December 16, epidemic trend estimates indicate that influenza infections are growing or likely growing in 47 states and the timing of this increase in activity is similar to several past seasons. Influenza seasons vary widely in number of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths, depending on the subtypes circulating, population immunity, and vaccine effectiveness against circulating influenza viruses. A new influenza A(H3N2) virus subclade recently renamed \"subclade K\" is the predominant virus among influenza A(H3N2) viruses that have been genetically characterized to date this fall in the United States and other countries, including the UK and Canada . CDC first identified Subclade K in the United States in August 2025, and as of December 19, approximately 90% of influenza A(H3N2) viruses that CDC has genetically characterized from U.S. samples collected since September 28 were identified as subclade K. Influenza viruses in this subclade have differences from other circulating influenza viruses including the virus selected as the A(H3N2) component of the U.S. 2025-26 seasonal influenza vaccines. In our initial outlook, we assessed that a more severe 2025-2026 influenza season could occur if an influenza subtype with more severe outcomes, either through higher clinical severity or higher numbers of infections, predominates. The emergence of subclade K could lead to a more severe 2025-2026 influenza season. However, the impact of the emergence of subclade K on the timing and severity of the 2025-2026 influenza season is unclear. Individual and population-level immunity to subclade K influenza viruses might be low and annual influenza vaccine effectiveness might be reduced. In addition, seasons that are H3N2 predominant (the same virus type as subclade K) have been associated with more influenza-associated hospitalizations and deaths in people 65 years and older and in young children compared to other age groups.\n[note 4] Note 4: the highlighted line corresponds to the age group in the subplot title, grey lines correspond to all other age groups.

Respiratory DataMart System Respiratory DataMart is a sentinel laboratory-based surveillance system where participating laboratories report positive and negative test results for a number of respiratory viruses from samples primarily taken in hospital. A small proportion of primary care samples are also included in this reporting. In week 42, data is based on reporting from 9 out of the 14 sentinel laboratories. In week 42, 4,656 respiratory specimens reported through the Respiratory DataMart System were tested for influenza. There were 324 positive samples for influenza: 118 influenza A (not subtyped), 172 influenza A (H3N2), 30 influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, and 9 influenza B.

Lowest activity for influenza: identified as weeks in a given year when, for at least two consecutive weeks, <2% of tests for influenza in those weeks are positive. Week 27 through Week 26 of the following calendar year was used to define a surveillance year in order to capture summer COVID-19 activity as the start of a given season. Lowest activity weeks for ARI were identified as weeks when COVID-19, influenza, and RSV were all identified as having low activity according to their separate thresholds. For each state within a region, the reference periods were used to calculate the values that created the levels (categories) for the 2025-2026 surveillance year. First, we calculated the weekly percentage of ED visits attributed to each pathogen and ARI overall within the identified lowest activity periods. Next, we calculated the mean, M, and standard deviation, S, attributed to each pathogen and ARI overall within the identified lowest activity periods. The mean was considered the baseline value for each state and was used as the top value for the Very Low category. Then, we computed the maximum number of standard deviations above the mean for any observed week over all weeks in the three previous seasons (N = maximum number of standard deviations = ( - M) / S). The maximum number of standard deviations (N) was divided by 4 and multiplied by the standard deviation (S = standard deviation). This value was denoted as D, so D = (N / 4) * S. Using X = percent of ED visits in a week for each pathogen and ARI overall, we classified activity levels as follows: Very Low: X <= M, activity at or below baseline Low: M < X <= M + D Moderate: M + D < X <= M + 2D High: M + 2D < X <= + 3D Very High: M + 3D < X Missouri: Due to data quality issues, Missouri's historical data before MMWR Week 10 of 2025 (March 2-8, 2025) could not be used for computing levels, thus leaving insufficient data.

As the quarterly figures fluctuate a lot, AAP FactCheck also looked at annual figures. Figures for the year to June 2020 show coal consumption declined by three per cent between 2018 and 2020, from 1,157,243 tonnes to 1,153,579 tonnes. MBIE also reports quarterly on the make-up of New Zealand's electricity generation (table 1). Figures for the year to June show coal-powered electricity generation increased by 51.6 per cent between 2018 and 2020, from 1261GWh to 1912GWh. The figures also show gas-powered electricity generation declined by 10.3 per cent, from 6,354GWh in 2018 to 5,701GWh in 2020. However, MBIE's annual report on the energy sector said the increase in coal-powered generation was due to lower hydro electricity generation as the result of a dry year and maintenance at NZ's largest gas field, which reduced the supply of gas (page 14). \"Electricity generation from coal increased by 43 per cent in 2019,\" the report said. \"This was due to the need for non-renewable generation as a result of less favourable hydrological conditions, and gas outages meaning that there was less gas available for electricity generation use.\" (page 14) The report does not mention that the oil and gas exploration ban has had an impact on the supply of gas. It shows gas production is expected to increase in the near future before steadily declining (page 43, Fig E.7). The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment (PCE) investigated the impact of the government's oil and gas exploration ban and noted that the recent increase in coal-powered generation was \"not because of the ban\" (page 40). It found that, in future, a reduction in gas supply for electricity generation could result in more coal being used as it is currently the cheapest substitute (page 40). But it said \"coal is unlikely to play a role in New Zealand's electricity sector for much longer\" due to the Emissions Trading Scheme and coal being phased out by major generators (page 41). It found New Zealand's remaining gas reserves would probably be sufficient for intermittent electricity generation when hydro dams are low \"for several decades to come, albeit at a higher cost than at present\" (page 39).

The Statement \"The oil and gas exploration ban, what did that do, actually, our coal use has now gone up so now we've got more coal being used instead of natural gas to actually create electricity.\" Judith Collins, National Party leader, September 30, 2020. The Analysis National Party leader Judith Collins says the government's efforts to combat climate change have backfired and New Zealand is using more coal as a result of its offshore oil and gas exploration ban. In April 2018, the Labour-led government announced it would not issue any new permits for offshore oil and gas exploration . The policy became law in February 2019 . During the Newshub Leaders' Debate on September 30, Ms Collins said the policy had resulted in an increase in carbon emissions . (Video mark 1hr, 8min, 30secs). \"The oil and gas exploration ban, what did that do, actually our coal use has now gone up so now we've got more coal being used instead of natural gas to actually create electricity,\" Ms Collins said. AAP FactCheck examined Ms Collins statement that coal use had gone up and more coal is being used to generate electricity instead of gas, as a result of the government's offshore oil and gas exploration ban. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) publishes figures on coal consumption , which do not show an increase in coal consumption after the ban became law.

As the quarterly figures fluctuate a lot, AAP FactCheck also looked at annual figures.

And while Biden opposes vouchers for private school tuition \u2014 the ultimate in school choice for some \u2014 he does not oppose students choosing between public schools, magnet schools and high-performing charter schools. Trump\u2019s attack on Biden was gleaned from policy recommendations drafted by Biden and his former rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders. The 110-page document, called the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force Recommendations, was released July 8 and is not the official Democratic Party platform. Nevertheless, Trump has seized on the document to make a number of misleading claims about Biden\u2019s positions, some of which we have written about previously. In three recent tele-rallies, Trump repeatedly cited the document and misrepresented it: \u201cI saw this two days ago for the first time. He wants to end school choice, no school choice, and abolish charter schools.\u201d \u2013 Trump at a tele-rally in Wisconsin, July 17. \u201cThey want to abolish school choice, end school choice, abolish all charter schools.\u201d \u2013 Trump at a tele-rally in Michigan, July 18 . \u201cI can\u2019t even believe they\u2019re serious, but they seem to be.

That plan has been opposed by many Democrats \u2014 some view it as yet another attempt at vouchers for private schools \u2014 and it has not advanced in Congress . So when Trump says Biden opposes school choice, it\u2019s true that he opposes vouchers for private schools. But not everyone defines school choice that way. According to a Biden campaign official, \u201cJoe Biden opposes the Trump/Devos conception of \u2018school choice,\u2019 which is private school vouchers that would destroy our public schools. He\u2019s also against for-profit and low-performing charter schools, and believes in holding all charter schools accountable.

They typically have a curricular focus \u2014 like STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) \u2014 and students from across the school system with an interest in that curricular focus can attend. In short, whether Biden opposes school choice depends on one\u2019s definition of school choice. Some consider offering choices between traditional public schools, magnet schools and charter schools to be \u201cchoice\u201d \u2014 which Biden supports. Others define choice as federal support for private school tuition \u2014 which Biden opposes. The Department of Education, in a 2019 report on school choice , defines \u201cschool choice\u201d as \u201can array of elementary and secondary education options\u201d that includes traditional public schools \u201cwithin or across districts,\u201d public charter schools, private schools and homeschooling.

Charter schools are doing great.\u201d \u2014 President Donald Trump, remarks in the Rose Garden, July 14, 2020 \u201cAbolish school choice, end school choice, abolish \u2014 they want to abolish all school choice, end it. They want to abolish charter schools. This is just never-ending.\u201d \u2014 Trump, remarks during an Arizona telerally, July 18, 2020 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 As president, Bill Clinton was considered a powerful advocate for promoting charter schools, even winning the first-ever lifetime achievement award from the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools. Now, President Donald Trump is charging that former vice president Joe Biden (and his fellow Democrats) has gone so far left that he wants to \u201cabolish all charter schools.\u201d These are publicly funded schools but operated under contract by independent groups, allowing for more flexibility in curriculum and hiring. Is there much basis for Trump\u2019s claim? Let\u2019s examine what Biden stands for \u2014 as well as his position on \u201cschool choice,\u201d which Trump also claims he wants to abolish. Trump claims he\u2019s citing a portion of the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force Recommendations, designed to bridge policy gaps between Biden, who has a record as a centrist, and his last rival for the Democratic nomination, the left-leaning Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. The section on charter schools was eventually added to the draft Democratic Party platform for 2020: \u201cCharter schools were originally intended to be publicly funded schools with increased flexibility in program design and operations. Democrats believe that education is a public good and should not be saddled with a private profit motive, which is why we will ban for-profit private charter businesses from receiving federal funding. And we recognize the need for more stringent guardrails to ensure charter schools are good stewards of federal education funds. We support measures to increase accountability for charter schools, including by requiring all charter schools to meet the same standards of transparency as traditional public schools, including with regard to civil rights protections, racial equity, admissions practices, disciplinary procedures, and school finances. We will call for conditioning federal funding for new, expanded charter schools or for charter school renewals on a district\u2019s review of whether the charter will systematically underserve the neediest students. And Democrats oppose\nof Public Policy at Georgetown University. \u201cHe opposes spending public money to send students to private schools (vouchers/tuition tax credits/opportunity scholarships). He is opposed to for-profit charter schools and \u2018low-performing\u2019 charter schools. But he\u2019s not opposed to charter schools per se. And he\u2019s not opposed to providing students choices within public school systems via magnet schools \u2026 So Trump\u2019s blanket claims are false.\u201d Advertising The Trump campaign stood by Trump\u2019s statements. \u201cInstead of giving parents the opportunity to send their children to a better school, Joe Biden wants to end school choice as we know it,\u201d Trump campaign spokesman Zach Parkinson said. \u201cBiden not only attended a private school himself, he also sent his own children to one, exercising a choice he would deny other parents. From pledging to \u2018end\u2019 charter schools to saying they won\u2019t receive \u2018a penny of federal money\u2019 if he is elected, Biden has made his hostility to school choice abundantly clear. Biden has turned his back on these parents and children, and if elected, would put charter schools on a path to destruction.\u201d A case could be made that Biden has signed onto concepts that could slow the expansion of charter schools \u2014 or that Biden is opposed to providing federal funding for \u201csome\u201d charter schools (the for-profit ones). The distinctions are subtle and certainly open to debate. But instead, Trump tries to create a cartoon version of Biden\u2019s position, sweepingly declaring that Biden wants to \u201cabolish all charter schools.\u201d That\u2019s simply wrong, given how charter schools are run at the local level.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the far-left flank of his party. Speaking in Wilmington, Del., Biden promised a \u201cclean energy revolution,\u201d which he said would deliver millions of jobs, as he attacked President Trump for calling climate change a \u201choax.\u201d Biden detailed what he called a pro-union platform that would replace the US government\u2019s car fleet with American-made electric vehicles and includes a pledge to create a \u201ccarbon pollution-free electric sector by the year 2025.\u201d \u201cThere is no more consequential challenge that we must meet in the next decade than the onrushing climate crisis. Left unchecked, it is literally an existential threat to the health of our planet and to our very survival,\u201d said Biden, 77. Biden\u2019s announcement comes as the presidential wannabe courts idols on the left of his party including Bronx-Queens Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the hope that they will support him and steer young voters his way in November. In May, AOC announced she had been selected to co-chair Biden\u2019s climate change panel along with former Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. Photo by OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images The former veep on Tuesday promised to \u201ccreate millions of high-paying union jobs by building a modern infrastructure and a clean energy future\u201d and described his vision of a US covered in 500,000 electric car charging stations and thriving factories producing green products. \u201cWhen Donald Trump thinks about renewable energy, he sees windmills somehow causing cancer . When I think about these windmills, I see American manufacturing, American workers rising to dominate the global markets,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI see steel that will be needed for those windmill platforms, towers and ladders which could be made in small manufacturers,\u201d he said. \u201cI see the union-certified men and women who will manufacture and install.\u201d \u201cI see the ports that will come back to life and the longshoremen and the shipbuilders and the communities they support,\u201d he continued. The Green New Deal introduced by AOC \u2014 which even Democrats trashed \u2014 unanimously failed in a Senate vote last year. In a statement to Reuters after news broke that AOC was joining Biden\u2019s climate change panel, a spokesperson for the Democratic socialist\nbroadly align with an approach advocated by the left-wing of the Democratic party. Firstly, like the Green New Deal, Biden\u2019s plans reframe climate action as a jobs, infrastructure and clean energy stimulus . After three decades of economic elites failing to pitch a carbon tax as a solution to the supposed \u201cmarket failure\u201d of greenhouse gas emissions, Biden has elected to focus instead on economy-wide performance standards as the cutting edge of decarbonization. And while earlier generations of Democrats wanted consumers to foot the bill for that clean energy transition at the gas pump, a position shared by Milton Friedman , Biden takes Keynes and Franklin Roosevelt as his intellectual and political forebears. Perhaps most encouragingly, Biden views the workers, unions and communities of color most impacted by the fossil fuel economy and the potential shift away from it as deserving special attention. In his view, climate action cannot be separated from economic, environmental and social justice. This is, in the broadest strokes, the climate policy gospel according to many progressives. Biden\u2019s plans draw upon the Green New Deal-inflected recommendations issued by the joint taskforce convened by surrogates of the Biden and Bernie Sanders campaigns, including Ocasio-Cortez. They also crib heavily from plans devised by Washington governor Jay Inslee\u2019s climate-focused presidential campaign and are delightfully similar to policies drafted by Data for Progress , an upstart leftwing thinktank where I work. (Full disclosure: we provided research and recommendations to the joint taskforce and campaign.) Now, Biden would be wise to run on these ideas and staff up his administration to make them happen. Over recent months, public opinion research from Data for Progress has shown that climate change is a uniquely favorable general election issue for Biden and Democrats. When it comes to climate and clean energy priorities, voters trust the Democratic party more than the Republican party by an 18% margin . Climate change is a strong mobilization issue for the young voters Biden has struggled to attract to his campaign. In a May survey , 61% of voters under 45 said they would be more likely to vote for Biden if he committed to a platform that would move the United States to a 100% clean energy economy, with just 14% reporting that such a platform would make them less likely to support the Democratic nominee. A more recent survey fielded in late June by Climate Power, the\nNew Deal's timeline is more aggressive, calling for a 10-year national mobilization to generate \"100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources.\" Both the Green New Deal and Biden's plan call for overhauling the American transportation industry to reduce pollution and greenhouse gases by creating more public transit and pushing the country toward more hybrid and electric cars. Biden's plan puts forth proposals like giving Americans rebates to trade in gas-guzzling vehicles for more efficient American cars, incentivizing auto companies to offer more zero-emission vehicles, and investing in 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, among other ideas. Biden calls Trump a \"climate arsonist\" amid historic wildfires 02:33 One area where Biden's position has differed more significantly from environmental activists \u2014 and many of his rivals in the Democratic presidential primaries \u2014 has been on fracking. Fracking, short for hydraulic fracturing, is a drilling method for extracting natural gas from shale formations underground by injecting liquid at high pressure. Since 2005, the use of fracking in the U.S. has grown exponentially . Some energy experts forecast the U.S. will be the world's top exporter of natural gas within the next few years. While the Green New Deal does not explicitly mention anything about fracking, its timeline to cut emissions from the power sector is so rapid that eliminating fracking is implied in the proposal. Banning fracking has certainly been a priority among climate activists. However, fracking is a substantial source of jobs and revenue in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania, where some 32,000 workers are employed in the fracking and natural gas industry. Biden told voters there in July that fracking \"is not on the chopping block,\" though his campaign says he supports no new fracking on federal land. \"It is not surprising that Biden said he doesn't support a Green New Deal. He has a climate plan that's in line with science \u2014 but he has never vocally supported a GND,\" says Emily Atkin, a popular climate journalist who writes and hosts HEATED , a newsletter and podcast followed closely by many progressive climate crusaders. \"This is completely in line with who he said he was. Also, he's trying to win Pennsylvania.\" (According to the latest CBS News Battleground Tracker poll , Biden currently leads President Trump in the state by 5 points.) Though he's faced some criticism over fracking from\nfor Biden if he committed to a platform that would move the United States to a 100% clean energy economy, with just 14% reporting that such a platform would make them less likely to support the Democratic nominee. A more recent survey fielded in late June by Climate Power, the Global Strategies Group and Data for Progress found that bold climate action was also persuasive for middle-of-the-road and Latino voters. Even after survey respondents were shown strong messaging attacks from Trump and Republicans claiming that Democrats wanted to pass a $100tn Green New Deal that would increase taxes \u2013 as well as more outlandish arguments that Democrats were going to take away hamburgers, pickup trucks and airplanes \u2013 voters moved even further in Democrats\u2019 direction. Middle partisans shifted two percentage points further in favor of Biden, while Latinos leaned a further four points towards him. These findings show that one of Trump and Republicans\u2019 favorite act: that \u201cVenezuela-style socialists are going to take away the American way of life\u201d \u2013 doesn\u2019t work. In fact, an analysis of the 2019 Cooperative Congressional Election Study published by Data for Progress found that 2016 Trump voters who are unsure how they will vote in 2020 are uniquely cross-pressured on climate issues. They view climate change as being much more important than other 2016 Trump voters and side with Biden and Democrats on key policy issues, like the Paris Climate Agreement and Clean Power Plan. Crucially, they also tend to be young, meaning that if Democrats can attract these voters in 2020, they could grow their base for years to come. As Biden prepares for election day in November, he would be wise to run on his Green New Deal-style climate plan. And if he wins \u2013 which polls suggest he will \u2013 he\u2019s going to need to staff up to turn these campaign promises into laws. Here, activists still have a lot of leverage. The most recent polling from Data for Progress shows that 44% of voters would be more likely to support a candidate who doesn\u2019t take money from fossil fuel companies, executives and lobbyists and that 49% would be opposed to industry representatives receiving appointments to government agencies and the White House. These are strange and scary times. The pandemic has laid bare some of the most devastating and brutal flaws of our corrupt president and our nakedly capitalist society. The\nattempting to tackle other related issues such as environmental justice, sustainable housing, supporting a \"just transition\" for workers whose jobs are affected, and the building of major infrastructure projects such as high speed rail, which is mentioned in both proposals. Green jobs and infrastructure At their core, both the Green New Deal and Biden's climate plan are about jobs as well as the environment. They both place an emphasis on supporting labor unions' right to organize and bargain for fair wages for their members. The Green New Deal sets a goal of providing a guaranteed job with a family-sustaining wage and benefits to every American \u2014 but Biden does not go that far. Biden's jobs plan is big, but not as comprehensive as the Green New Deal's. He pledges to create millions of new jobs by retooling the auto industry for low-emission vehicles, building infrastructure for a green future, upgrading millions of buildings to be more energy efficient, constructing 1.5 million new sustainable housing units, and cleaning up pollution from oil and gas wells and coal mining sites. \"When Donald Trump thinks about climate change, he thinks 'hoax.' I think 'jobs',\" Biden has said . He aims to provide additional jobs out of the pandemic by boosting this green energy economy. Climate change is also expected to continually increase major stresses on America's already aging infrastructure. To address this, both plans call for major investments to, as the Green New Deal puts it, \"meet the challenges of the 21st century.\" Biden's plan calls for making \"smart infrastructure investments to rebuild the nation and to ensure that our buildings, water, transportation, and energy infrastructure can withstand the impacts of climate change.\" However, on housing, Biden's proposal to build 1.5 million new sustainable housing units is far short of the lofty ambitions of the Green New Deal, which calls for \"providing all people of the United States with affordable, safe, and adequate housing.\" Carbon emissions and fracking On emissions reductions, Biden's plan calls for a carbon pollution-free U.S. power sector by 2035, with net-zero emissions throughout the economy by 2050. The Green New Deal's timeline is more aggressive, calling for a 10-year national mobilization to generate \"100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources.\" Both the Green New Deal and Biden's plan call for overhauling the American transportation industry to reduce pollution and"}], "source": "rag_only"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 5, "concluded_by_rag": true, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.6}

The DOL will have to go through a rulemaking process to determine how low to drop it. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that workers won\u2019t end up making less, as the DOL has announced it won\u2019t be enforcing the EO in the meantime. In other words, companies can illegally pay federal contractors less than the current minimum wage and face no consequences. It\u2019s just the latest example of the White House openly ignoring the law. Many workers technically have protections through labor laws like the McNamara-O\u2019Hara Service Contract Act and the Davis-Bacon Act, which are supposed to require prevailing wages by certain federal contractors. However, these laws have not been updated to keep up with inflation and are largely inadequate in the current economy. As a Center for American Progress report points out, many of the market wages established by these laws are less than the $17.75 hourly wage that Trump just nixed. \u201cA nursing assistant on a federal contract in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, has a minimum wage of only $13.17 ; a food service worker in parts of Mississippi, Tennessee, and Arkansas has a minimum wage of $12.06 ; and a landscape laborer on a construction site in Grand Rapids, Michigan, has a minimum wage of just $10.47 ,\u201d explains the report. Anti-Union Moves The Trump administration knows there is power\nin a statement. \u201cIn the year 2025, a job should lift you out of poverty, not keep you in it. At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, we can no longer tolerate millions of workers trying to survive on just $10 or $12 an hour. Congress can no longer ignore the needs of the working class of this country. The time to act is now.\u201d Earlier this month, Sanders forced a vote on the issue, as part of the Senate Budget Resolution, but it was rejected by the Republican majority. A report from the NELP notes that the bill would particularly benefit women and workers of color. The group estimates that Black workers would make an additional $3,200 a year; nearly 25 percent of Latino workers would see a raise; and 1 in 4 women would get paid more. It would also undoubtedly improve the overall economy. \u201cA $17 minimum wage by 2028 would generate $86 billion in higher wages for workers and would also benefit communities across the country,\u201d explains the report. \u201cBecause underpaid workers spend much of their extra earnings, this injection of wages will help stimulate the economy and spur greater business activity and job growth.\u201d On the campaign trail, and even after winning the election, Trump waffled on the issue of raising the minimum wage. When asked about potentially raising it in December 2024, he told NBC News , \u201cIt\u2019s a very low number, I will agree, it\u2019s a very low number. Let me give you the downside, though: In California, they raised it up to a very high number, and your restaurants are going out of business all over the place. The population is shrinking, it\u2019s had a very negative impact. But there is a level at which you could do it, absolutely.\u201d It\u2019s clear that Trump is no longer undecided on the issue. Media that fights fascism Truthout is funded almost entirely by readers \u2014 that\u2019s why we can speak truth to power and cut against the mainstream narrative.

The move was a clear act of retaliation against the AFGE, which represents TSA employees and has continually sought to restrain the administration in court. The TSA negotiated a seven-year labor agreement last year, which included the addition of parental bereavement leave and expanded shift trade options for workers. On April 8, Trump\u2019s attacks on the federal workforce got a boost from the right-wing Supreme Court. In a 7-2 ruling, the court paused an order from a San Francisco judge that required the administration to reinstate the more than 16,000 workers who were terminated earlier this year. Thousands more could be facing unemployment, thanks to a rule proposed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on April 18. The mandate would reclassify tens of thousands of federal workers as \u201cat-will\u201d employees, stripping them of civil service protections and enabling Trump to fire them en masse. \u201cMoving forward, career government employees, working on policy matters, will be classified as \u2018Schedule Policy/Career,\u2019 and will be held to the highest standards of conduct and performance,\u201d Trump wrote on social media after the rule was announced. \u201cIf these government workers refuse to advance the policy interests of the president, or are engaging in corrupt behavior, they should no longer have a job.\u201d The OPM estimates that 50,000 workers would be reclassified, which is about 2 percent of the federal workforce. Raise the Wage Act While Trump aims to reduce wages, many lawmakers are pushing to raise them. Led by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), Democrats recently reintroduced the Raise the Wage Act , which aims to bring the federal minimum wage up to $17 an hour by 2030. Despite the rapidly rising cost of living the United States, the federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 since 2009, the longest period without an increase since it was established in 1938. An economic analysis of the move suggests it could provide a raise for some 22 million people. \u201cThe $7.25 an hour minimum wage is a starvation wage. It must be raised to a living wage \u2014 at least $17 an hour,\u201d said Sanders in a statement. \u201cIn the year 2025, a job should lift you out of poverty, not keep you in it. At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, we can no longer tolerate millions of workers trying to survive on just $10 or $12 an hour. Congress can no\nHome Care Workers' Rights to Minimum Wage Must Be Protected Skip to main content The Trump Administration is trying to gut employment rights for home care workers through the federal rulemaking process . After many decades of organizing, home care workers finally won basic employment protections in 2015, including the right to federal minimum wage and overtime. They had been shut out from these basic employment rights for more than 75 years. In 1938, when Congress enacted the Fair Labor Standards Act, establishing federal minimum wage and overtime rights, home care workers were intentionally excluded from these protections . And in 1974, when minimum wage and overtime laws were extended to other domestic workers, many home care employers used regulatory loopholes meant for \u201ccompanions\u201d and \u201ccasual babysitters\u201d to continue to deny home care workers these rights. Many home care employers used regulatory loopholes meant for \u2018companions\u2019 and \u2018casual babysitters\u2019 to deny home care workers the most basic employment rights. As a result, a much-needed workforce of majority women, people of color, and immigrants continued to be underpaid for their essential work of bathing, changing dressings, and conducting other tasks that enable individuals to live at home. Meanwhile, the for-profit agencies employing home care workers pocketed most of the payments, including Medicaid reimbursements that cover in-home care, instead of paying decent wages. The Trump Administration plans to return to that time by getting rid of the protections workers won in 2015 by labeling home care workers exempt \u201ccompanions\u201d instead of employees. The results will be disastrous. An Essential Workforce Now Under Attack Most people with disabilities and older adults prefer to live at home, increasing the demand for in-home care and services. The industry has boomed since the mid-1970s, becoming one of the fastest-growing sectors, with a workforce that includes nearly three million home care workers . In response to these dramatic shifts, in 2011, President Obama instructed the Labor Department to rewrite the regulations to clarify that home care workers would be guaranteed the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour and time-and-a-half for overtime. The new rule was finalized in 2015. A decade later, Trump\u2019s Department of Labor (DOL) has proposed rulemaking to take away even those minimal protections. This is terrible policy for three reasons. First, home care worker wages are abysmally low, meaning they cannot feed their families and make ends meet. As of 2023 , \u201calmost\nthe minimum wage? You of course support a $15 federal minimum wage,\" Welker said at the debate. \"I do,\" Biden responded. During this exchange, Trump interjected, offering a position that wasn\u2019t as clear-cut in favor of a wage hike as Biden\u2019s was, but that also didn\u2019t close the door on it. Trump expressed concern that the wage hike could result in employers laying off lower-wage employees. \"How are you helping your small businesses when you\u2019re forcing wages? What\u2019s going to happen, and what\u2019s been proven to happen, is when you do that, these small businesses fire many of their employees,\" Trump said. Trump added his preference for state-by-state minimum wages. \"Alabama is different than New York. New York is different from Vermont. Every state is different. It should be a state option.\" (It\u2019s worth noting that no change would be required for this to happen, since states can already set a minimum wage higher than the federal level.) That said, Trump added that he\u2019d \"consider it to an extent \u2026 in a second administration. But not to a level that\u2019s going to put all these businesses out of business. It should be a state option.\" The 2019 minimum wage bill One thing that\u2019s clear is that the White House officially opposed a bill to enact $15 minimum wage in 2019. That came when the House was considering H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage Act . All but six Democrats voted for the measure while only three Republicans voted for it. The bill would phase in a $15 minimum wage over a seven-year period. As the measure was being considered in the House, the White House weighed in, as White Houses often do on major pieces of legislation, in a document known as a Statement of Administration Policy . The administration wrote that a $15 an hour minimum wage would \"reverse\" recent economic progress \"and hurt workers. \u2026 The successful efforts to reduce taxes, eliminate regulations, and implement fairer trade deals are driving economic growth and increasing workers\u2019 take-home pay far more effectively and efficiently than legislation like H.R. 582, which would eliminate jobs and reduce total wages for American workers.\" The document concluded that \"if H.R. 582 were presented to the president in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he veto it.\" The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry to clarify the president\u2019s current position.

Posted 2020-07-10T22:54:14+00:00 - Updated 2020-07-10T22:52:08+00:00 By Daniel Dale , CNN In public comments and in advertising, President Donald Trump and his allies have tried to cast Democratic opponent Joe Biden as an anti-police radical. They have had a hard time. Biden, a lead author of strict crime legislation when he served as a US senator, has explicitly rejected calls to \"defund the police.\" He has also proposed an increase in funding for a community policing program to which Trump has previously proposed budget cuts. Other WRAL Top Stories The Trump team is now attacking Biden over two comments he made in a video conversation with a progressive activist on Wednesday. In both cases, though, the attacks left out critical context. In the second case, about Biden's views on police funding, the attacks were aided by the fact that an edited video of the conversation published by a progressive entity, NowThis News, left out some key words from the former vice president. The \"enemy\" comment Vice President Mike Pence claimed in a tweet on Thursday night that Biden \"referred to the police (as) 'the enemy.'\" At a police union rally in Pennsylvania earlier in the day, Pence made a slightly longer accusation: \"I heard that, just yesterday, Joe Biden said that well-armed police, in his words, 'become the enemy.'\" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany tweeted Thursday, \"Joe Biden says police have 'become the ENEMY.' How disgusting & sad!\" The Trump campaign and Donald Trump Jr. also highlighted the \"enemy\" quote. All of these comments omitted critical context. Facts First: Biden was speaking specifically about residents' perceptions of police who enter communities in armored military vehicles -- saying that this looks like \"the military invading\" and makes police \"become the enemy.\" \"Vice President Biden has spoken out for years against providing police with equipment that only belongs in war zones, and was highlighting that doing so has the potential to worsen divides between the public servants who put their lives on the line to keep us all safe and the people they serve,\" said Biden spokesman Andrew Bates, adding that Biden's\ndon't do the following, they don't get any help.\" Noting that most police funding comes from local and state governments, Biden continued, \"It's only the federal government comes in on top of that, and so it says, 'You want help? You have to do the following reforms: you have to make sure you have no-knock warrants eliminated, if you have them, you don't get Byrne grants. If you have them, boom.'\" In summary: Biden did say he is open to redirecting some funding. But he followed that comment by simply reiterating his previous proposal to reject federal funding for departments that do not meet certain conditions, not by taking a new stance. And a Biden campaign official said that Biden endorsing the idea of redirecting \"some of the funding\" is in line with his June comments about how it makes sense to reduce police budgets in \"some places.\" Bates, the Biden spokesman, said Trump is \"desperate to run against a fictitious opponent instead of Joe Biden.\" related Videos watch \u00b7 2:25 WRAL WeatherCenter Forecast watch \u00b7 1:28 Evening Pick 3 Pick 4 and Cash 5 watch \u00b7 0:59 Powerball Drawing watch \u00b7 1:22 Daytime Pick 3 and Pick 4 Drawing watch \u00b7 0:41 Mega Millions Drawing \u2022 Credits Copyright 2026 by Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The Trump campaign has also issued television ads around the false claim . The city of Ripon, about 22 miles west of Fond du Lac, is known as the birthplace of the Republican Party, which formed there in 1854 at a schoolhouse that is now a historic landmark . Pence spoke at Ripon College, at an indoor space with attendance limited to 50 people . Attendees wore masks. Pence wore a mask when he entered but took it off during his address, despite campus rules requiring everyone inside buildings at the private college to wear a mask. Pence is scheduled to have a second campaign appearance in Wisconsin Friday afternoon, when he will tour a dairy farm and hold a roundtable discussion in Onalaska on the impact of Trump administration trade policy on local farmers.

Biden made the comment in a video conversation with Ady Barkan, a prominent progressive activist who has ALS and just endorsed Biden. An edited version of the conversation, which cut out some of Biden's comments, was posted by NowThis News. (Mike Casca, spokesman for Barkan's Be a Hero political action committee, said the edits were done collaboratively between NowThis News and Be a Hero.) The Biden campaign provided CNN with an audio clip that included relevant comments the video did not include. Biden spoke to Barkan about how to improve policing. He called for a focus on community policing -- those comments did not appear in the video -- and for federal \"pattern or practice\" investigations into troubled police departments. He also criticized no-knock warrants for drug cases. And Biden said the federal government should have access to records about officers' misconduct. Then he touted the Obama-Biden administration's efforts to reduce the transfer of surplus military equipment to local police departments. \"Surplus military equipment for law enforcement: they don't need that. The last thing you need is an up-armored Humvee coming into a neighborhood; it's like the military invading. They don't know anybody, they become the enemy; they're supposed to be protecting these people,\" he said. Clearly, the \"enemy\" comment was not some sort of general assessment of police officers or even a statement about how police officers are generally seen by communities. It was specifically about perceptions of police who use particular equipment in particular circumstances. Also, when Pence claimed Biden said \"well-armed\" police become the enemy, he may have created the impression that Biden said that police become the enemy when they carry powerful guns. Biden was talking about surplus military vehicles. The comment about funding Pence claimed in his Thursday tweet that Biden had just called for police \"to be defunded.\" Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh, like Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, suggested Biden had changed his position under pressure. Murtaugh tweeted: \"It didn't take Biden long to cave in to\ncomment about funding Pence claimed in his Thursday tweet that Biden had just called for police \"to be defunded.\" Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh, like Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, suggested Biden had changed his position under pressure. Murtaugh tweeted: \"It didn't take Biden long to cave in to the extreme left and agree to Defund the Police.\" This Biden comment about funding was more ambiguous than the \"enemy\" remark, so the claims of Trump's allies are, in our view, less egregious. But the context the Trump allies haven't highlighted -- some of which was missing from the video -- casts Biden's words in a different light. Facts First: Biden explicitly told Barkan that he opposes defunding or abolishing the police; this comment was omitted from the video. Biden did say he \"absolutely\" agrees that some funding can be redirected, but it was not exactly clear what he meant -- and he immediately transitioned to his previous proposal to deny federal funding to specific police departments that do not meet certain standards. Contrary to suggestions of a recent flip-flop, Biden said in early June that it makes sense for some local communities to reduce police funding. \"Though Ady would have loved Joe Biden to announce in this interview that he is in favor of defunding the police, the Vice President never said it,\" Liz Jaff, president of Be a Hero, said in a statement. Here's the context. In June, when calls to \"defund the police\" gained prominence on the left amid the national protests that followed the killing of George Floyd in the custody of Minneapolis police, Biden said, \"No, I don't support defunding the police.\" Rather, he said, he supports conditioning federal money to police \"based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness.\" Biden also said in early June that it \"makes sense\" for \"some places\" to reallocate some funding away from their police departments, since some places do not have enough officers but others \"have a lot more than they need.\" He said the decision depends on the particular community. Still, Biden has drawn criticism from some defunding advocates for his campaign proposal to make a \"$300 million investment\" in the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program to which Trump has previously proposed budget cuts. Trump has nonetheless accused Biden of wanting to defund the police.

Therefore, we cannot definitively assess whether she indeed missed key details without additional information.\n\n4. **General Understanding of Lincoln's Judicial Appointments**: Historically, Lincoln did make significant judicial appointments, and his views on the judiciary were influenced by the political climate of his time, particularly during the Civil War.

And Joanna paid each of our grandchildren a certain amount of money to memorize the Gettysburg address. And the reason the reason that that that what we want them to pick up there and what I want those students to pick up, if I can remember the first two lines, is that for four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought up, created upon this uh, here a new country, a country that was dedicated uh, to uh, liberty. And the proposition that all men are created equal, conceived in liberty. Those are his words and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. He meant women too. And we are now engaged in a great civil war to determine whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure. See those are the words. I want to see an experiment. And that's what he thought. It's an experiment. And I found some letters that George Washington wrote where he said the same thing. It's an experiment that experiment existed then. Because even the liberals in europe, you know, they're looking over here and they say the great idea in principle, but it'll never work. But we'll show them. It does.

Skip to Content Donald Trump stages a check presentation with an enlarged copy of a $100,000 contribution from the Donald J. Trump Foundation to Puppy Jake, a veteran's charity, at a campaign event in Davenport, Iowa on Jan. 30, 2016. Paul Sancya / AP file Nov. 14, 2019, 4:50 AM EST / Updated Nov. 14, 2019, 5:47 PM EST By Philip Hackney Last week, Justice Saliann Scarpulla of the New York Supreme Court ordered President Donald Trump to pay $2 million in restitution to charity after admitting to New York Attorney General Letitia James that he and his children had violated their fiduciary duties as officers and directors of the now-shuttered Donald J. Trump Foundation . As a result of that failure, charitable dollars \u2014 consistently and over many years \u2014 often benefited Trump rather than the causes the president has repeatedly claimed he supports. The Trump Foundation has done great work and given away lots of money, both mine and others, to great charities over the years - with me taking NO fees, rent, salaries etc. Now, as usual, I am getting slammed by Cuomo and the Dems in a long running civil lawsuit started by..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 19, 2018 Scarpulla\u2019s Nov. 7 order, along with the stipulations obtained by the attorney general, are a great start to holding a wealthy family to account. Notably, such enforcement is rare. This is likely because of a serious lack of enforcement resources both at the state and federal levels. But I do not believe the judge\u2019s order should be the end of this matter . Charities must be publicly transparent; without transparency money dedicated to the public is subject to abuse. That abuse in turn undermines our confidence in a sector that provides services to some of our most vulnerable communities. But lost in the narrative about this decision \u2014 and indeed in this hectic news cycle \u2014 is the role of the IRS, the major regulator of nonprofits on a national scale. We still do not know whether the Trump Foundation and its officers and directors paid all the taxes it owed to the government, meaning the New York attorney general's investigation should be\nTrump had \"breached his fiduciary duty\" by allowing funds raised for US veterans to be used for the Iowa primary election in 2016. The money was raised in a televised fundraiser during a Republican primary debate that Mr Trump skipped. \"I direct Mr Trump to pay the $2,000,000, which would have gone to the Foundation if it were still in existence,\" the judge wrote, saying it must be paid by Mr Trump himself and should go to eight charities he has no relationship to. Mr Trump said the case had been resolved and that he was \"happy to donate\" $2m to the Army Emergency Relief, Children's Aid Society, City Meals-on-Wheels, Give an Hour, Martha's Table, United Negro College Fund, United Way of Capital Area and the US Holocaust Memorial Museum. Ms James said Mr Trump had admitted to \"personally misusing funds at the Trump Foundation\". She had asked Judge Scarpulla to ban Mr Trump from ever running a charity again. However, this was not imposed. Donald Trump Jr, Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump - who were also directors of the Trump Foundation - are required to undergo mandatory training \"on the duties of officers and directors of charities\", Ms James said. The case was opened following an investigation into the Trump Foundation by the Washington Post in 2016.

Trump Pays Court-Ordered $2 Million For Illegally Using Trump Foundation Funds December 10, 2019 Trump Ordered to Pay Eight Separate Charities $250,000 Each Remaining $1.8 Million in Trump Foundation Bank Account Disbursed Among Charities NEW YORK \u2013 New York Attorney General Letitia James today released the following statement after Donald J. Trump was forced to pay more than $2 million in court-ordered damages to eight different charities for illegally misusing charitable funds at the Trump Foundation for political purposes: \u201cNot only has the Trump Foundation shut down for its misconduct, but the president has been forced to pay $2 million for misusing charitable funds for his own political gain. Charities are not a means to an end, which is why these damages speak to the president\u2019s abuse of power and represent a victory for not-for-profits that follow the law. Funds have finally gone where they deserve \u2014 to eight credible charities. My office will continue to fight for accountability because no one is above the law \u2014 not a businessman, not a candidate for office, and not even the president of the United States.\u201d As part of a resolution of the lawsuit announced on November 7 th , Trump was ordered to pay $2 million, or $250,000, a piece to eight different charities. Those charities are Army Emergency Relief, the Children\u2019s Aid Society, Citymeals-on-Wheels, Give an Hour, Martha\u2019s Table, the United Negro College Fund, the United Way of National Capital Area, and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Additionally, Trump was forced to reimburse his namesake foundation $11,525 for sports paraphernalia and champagne purchased at a charity gala, which was added to $1,797,598.30 already in the foundation\u2019s bank account. The combined $1,809,123.30 was split evenly and recently transferred to the eight agreed upon charities. Each charity ended up receiving a total of $476,140.41. Additionally, as part of the settlement, Trump was required to agree to 19 admissions , acknowledging his personal misuse of funds at the Trump Foundation, and agreed to restrictions on future charitable service and ongoing reporting to the Office of the Attorney General, in the event he creates a new charity. The settlement also included mandatory training requirements for Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump, which the three children have already undergone. Finally, the settlement required the\nfoundation like a parasite taking over its host. Trump ordered to pay $2M after misusing his charity in 'shocking pattern of illegality' 03:16 At the center of this controversy is a 2016 nationally televised Iowa fundraiser, ostensibly organized by the foundation to raise money for veterans. Instead, Trump's presidential campaign used the foundation to promote Trump and to draw attention away from a Fox News debate taking place at the same time. The foundation did in fact raise money during the event, $2.8 million, which it publicly donated out to at least five different Iowa charities, ceremonially handing over a large check emblazoned with Trump's campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again.\" In effect, the New York judge found that Trump's fundraiser was just as much a way to help his presidential campaign as it was to help former members of the armed services. The attorney general had asked the court to order Trump to return the entire amount that was raised that day, or $2.8 million. But Scarpulla believed the monetary harm was somewhat lessened since the foundation did ultimately give money to charity, ordering $2 million in restitution. But that is not the end of the matter. If the Trump Foundation was participating in political campaigns, which New York State says it was, it and Trump would then owe back taxes to the IRS. The foundation is a special type of charity called a private foundation . Private foundations are typically formed and generally controlled by wealthy families, and Congress imposes significant, strict rules upon them. Lawmakers are clearly concerned that this type of situation, which today is illustrated by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Ford Foundation and the Walton Family Foundation, is ripe for abuse. And the Trump Foundation's actions suggest Congress is right to be worried. The rules imposed are particularly relevant to the Trump situation. One tax prohibits what is known as self-dealing . It is an excise tax of 10 percent of the amount taken from charity. And as Trump admits in the stipulations with the attorney general, he repeatedly violated the self-dealing rule. Congress also imposes an excise tax on foundations that spend money on political campaigns. The foundation and Trump are already familiar with this rule as well.

{"claim": "PEDOPHILIA is now LEGAL in CALIFORNIA", "label": "Refuted", "result": {"response": "To assess the factual accuracy of the statement \"PEDOPHILIA is now LEGAL in CALIFORNIA,\" we need to analyze the provided knowledge points regarding the changes in California's sex offender law.\n\n1. **Understanding the Law**: The new law (SB 145) signed by Governor Gavin Newsom allows judges discretion on whether to list an individual as a sex offender for consensual oral or anal sex with a minor aged 14 or older, provided the age difference is no more than ten years. This law was introduced to address perceived discrimination against LGBTQ individuals, as previous laws only applied to vaginal intercourse.\n\n2. **Age of Consent**: The age of consent in California remains 18. Any sexual activity involving a minor under this age can still lead to statutory rape charges. The law does not legalize sexual activity with minors but rather provides judicial discretion in specific consensual scenarios.\n\n3. **Controversy and Misinterpretation**: The law has faced criticism and is often misrepresented as legalizing pedophilia. However, the law does not change the fundamental legal framework regarding the age of consent or the criminalization of sexual acts with minors. It simply allows for more nuanced judicial discretion in certain cases.\n\n4. **Judicial Discretion**: The law is intended to apply to cases where both parties are close in age and where the sexual activity is consensual. It does not apply to cases involving minors under 14 or where the age gap exceeds ten years.\n\n5. **Public Reaction**: Critics, including some lawmakers, have expressed concerns that the law could be misused to justify inappropriate relationships, but supporters argue it is a necessary step toward equality in the legal treatment of sexual relationships involving minors.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement that \"PEDOPHILIA is now LEGAL in CALIFORNIA\" is misleading.

This type of judicial discretion is already granted in statutory rape cases involving a man who has vaginal sexual intercourse with a minor. However, it didn\u2019t include circumstances in which an adult engaged in consensual oral or anal sex with a minor. The old law was considered by many to discriminate against young LGBTQ individuals who engage in relationships with minors close to them in age by forcing them to register as a sex offender when heterosexuals in the same situation weren\u2019t required to register. Controversy still surrounds the law, however, because it allows a ten-year age gap in these relationships. Some opponents claim that the law protects pedophilia, no matter to whom it applies. The law was created for situations like those in which two teenagers are in a relationship and one reaches the age of 18 before the other. However, those against the law point out that it could also apply to a 24-year-old having sex with a 14-year-old, which they feel is unacceptable. The Initial Sex Offender Law The sex offender law that has been in place for decades in California gives judges the ability to decide if a man should be placed on the sex offender registry if he has voluntary sexual intercourse with a female between the ages of fourteen and seventeen and is no more than ten years older than the female. The age of consent in California is eighteen. Any adult engaging in sex with someone under the age of eighteen may face statutory rape charges. This aspect of California law remains unchanged; it is only the issue of the sex offender registry that is affected. When an adult is ordered to register as a sex offender, it is a lifelong order. The New Law and Its Implications The law was changed when SB 145 went into effect in September. Under the new law, the age of consent remains the same, and nothing changes when minors under\nfor decades, permits judges to decide whether a man should be placed on California's sex offender registry if he had voluntary intercourse with someone 14 to 17 years old and was no more than 10 years older than the person.But that discretion only applied to a man who had vaginal intercourse. The new change permits judges to use that same discretion when the case involves voluntary oral or anal sex.The measure won't apply when a minor is under 14, when the age gap is larger than 10 years, or when either party says the sex wasn't consensual.The law does not change the age of consent in California, which is 18. Adults caught having sex with minors will still face statutory rape charges.The bill was introduced by state Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat.The law ends discrimination \u201cby treating LGBTQ young people the exact same way that straight young people have been treated since 1944,\" Wiener said in a statement, adding: \u201cToday, California took yet another step toward an equitable society.\u201dEquality California, a nonprofit civil rights group that co-sponsored the bill with the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, also applauded Newsom's signing.\u201cIf we want a California for all, then we need a justice system that treats all Californians fairly and equally - regardless of who they are, what they look like or whom they love,\" Executive Director Rick Chavez Zbur said in the statement released by Wiener's office.The bill passed the Assembly and Senate on split votes, with some members objecting to what they saw as an easing of punishments against those who have sex with minors.\u201cI cannot in my mind as a mother understand how sex between a 24-year-old and a 14-year-old could ever be consensual, how it could ever not be a registrable offense,\u201d Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, D-San Diego, said before the bill's passage. \u201cWe should never give up on this idea that children should be in no way subject to a predator.\u201dOnline critics had falsely blasted the measure as legalizing pedophilia.The bill was supported by civil rights groups as well as the California District Attorneys Association and California Police Chiefs Association.

The New Law and Its Implications The law was changed when SB 145 went into effect in September. Under the new law, the age of consent remains the same, and nothing changes when minors under the age of thirteen are involved. The change simply alters the terms to make the law applicable to oral, anal sex, and vaginal sex, as opposed to vaginal sex alone. This gives judges discretion on whether to order sex offender registry for gay men involved with minors less than ten years younger than them. In contrast, they would have automatically been made to register previously. L.A. County District Attorney, Jackie Lacey, said, \u201cThis bill allows judges and prosecutors to evaluate cases involving consensual sex acts between young people, regardless of their sexual orientation, on an individual basis.\u201d Some Groups Show Support Although the law is still controversial, due to its very nature, some groups have lauded the change. The nonprofit civil rights group Equality California co-sponsored the new bill and supported Governor Newsom signing it into law. Their official statement said, \u201cIf we want a California for all, then we need a justice system that treats all Californians fairly and equally \u2013 regardless of who they are, what they look like, or whom they love.\u201d The law was also praised by Senator Scott Weiner, who introduced the bill. Some Express Outrage However, opponents of the bill maintain that the ten-year age gap is too liberal and allows for predatory behavior to go unpunished. It is assumed that judges wouldn\u2019t allow such cases to slip through the system, as the point of the law is not to make things easier on those guilty of sex crimes but instead to sort of bridge the gap in a complicated area. Lorena Gonzalez, a Democratic assemblywoman from San Diego, is one of those who spoke out against the law. She explained, \u201cI cannot, in my mind, as a mother, understand how sex between a 24-year-old and a 14-year-old could ever be consensual, how it could ever not be a registerable offense.\u201d Shannon Grove, California\u2019s Senate Republican Leader, is another opponent who spoke out against the new law.

Skip to Content Donald Trump stages a check presentation with an enlarged copy of a $100,000 contribution from the Donald J. Trump Foundation to Puppy Jake, a veteran's charity, at a campaign event in Davenport, Iowa on Jan. 30, 2016. Paul Sancya / AP file Nov. 14, 2019, 4:50 AM EST / Updated Nov. 14, 2019, 5:47 PM EST By Philip Hackney Last week, Justice Saliann Scarpulla of the New York Supreme Court ordered President Donald Trump to pay $2 million in restitution to charity after admitting to New York Attorney General Letitia James that he and his children had violated their fiduciary duties as officers and directors of the now-shuttered Donald J. Trump Foundation . As a result of that failure, charitable dollars \u2014 consistently and over many years \u2014 often benefited Trump rather than the causes the president has repeatedly claimed he supports. The Trump Foundation has done great work and given away lots of money, both mine and others, to great charities over the years - with me taking NO fees, rent, salaries etc. Now, as usual, I am getting slammed by Cuomo and the Dems in a long running civil lawsuit started by..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 19, 2018 Scarpulla\u2019s Nov. 7 order, along with the stipulations obtained by the attorney general, are a great start to holding a wealthy family to account. Notably, such enforcement is rare. This is likely because of a serious lack of enforcement resources both at the state and federal levels. But I do not believe the judge\u2019s order should be the end of this matter . Charities must be publicly transparent; without transparency money dedicated to the public is subject to abuse. That abuse in turn undermines our confidence in a sector that provides services to some of our most vulnerable communities. But lost in the narrative about this decision \u2014 and indeed in this hectic news cycle \u2014 is the role of the IRS, the major regulator of nonprofits on a national scale. We still do not know whether the Trump Foundation and its officers and directors paid all the taxes it owed to the government, meaning the New York attorney general's investigation should be\nrule. Congress also imposes an excise tax on foundations that spend money on political campaigns. The foundation and Trump are already familiar with this rule as well. Congress also imposes an excise tax on foundations that spend money on political campaigns. The foundation and Trump are already familiar with this rule as well, because Trump paid $2,500 to the IRS in a 2016 filing on behalf of the foundation after admitting to improperly sending $25,000 to the Pam Bondi campaign for attorney general in Florida in 2013. I believe that Trump and the Trump Foundation owe taxes at least pursuant to both categories above: Trump should owe a 10 percent self-dealing excise tax on that $2 million amount from the Iowa event, and a second 10 percent tax because of the event's political implications. Given that the foundation is shutting down and all other assets are supposedly being directed to charity, I believe Trump ought to pay both amounts personally, a total of $400,000. Now, it\u2019s likely that the Trump Foundation has actually violated other laws. For instance, until at least May of this year, Trump still had not paid the foundation for seemingly personal purchases totaling in the tens of thousands of dollars. The foundation now claims that those amounts have been repaid or will soon be repaid. But can we trust an organization with such a shady track record to hold itself accountable? Related Opinion Opinion We want to hear what you THINK. Please submit a letter to the editor. I would argue no, and I remain concerned about the president\u2019s operation of the foundation. Year after year, he signed the foundation\u2019s tax information returns. And now we know those returns contained false information. There has also been significant reporting about potentially improper estate and gift tax positions he and his family have taken advantage over many years. The culmination of this information suggests there is a real need for the IRS to make sure the Trump Foundation is held fully responsible for its fraud. And to do that, the IRS should really also do an independent audit of the president\u2019s own tax returns. The president's personal and charitable endeavors are so enmeshed, it would seem impossible to entangle one without full knowledge of the other. Scarpulla and James' efforts here are to be commended, but much work remains in holding Trump to account \u2014 at least in\nTrump had \"breached his fiduciary duty\" by allowing funds raised for US veterans to be used for the Iowa primary election in 2016. The money was raised in a televised fundraiser during a Republican primary debate that Mr Trump skipped. \"I direct Mr Trump to pay the $2,000,000, which would have gone to the Foundation if it were still in existence,\" the judge wrote, saying it must be paid by Mr Trump himself and should go to eight charities he has no relationship to. Mr Trump said the case had been resolved and that he was \"happy to donate\" $2m to the Army Emergency Relief, Children's Aid Society, City Meals-on-Wheels, Give an Hour, Martha's Table, United Negro College Fund, United Way of Capital Area and the US Holocaust Memorial Museum. Ms James said Mr Trump had admitted to \"personally misusing funds at the Trump Foundation\". She had asked Judge Scarpulla to ban Mr Trump from ever running a charity again. However, this was not imposed. Donald Trump Jr, Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump - who were also directors of the Trump Foundation - are required to undergo mandatory training \"on the duties of officers and directors of charities\", Ms James said. The case was opened following an investigation into the Trump Foundation by the Washington Post in 2016.

Trump Pays Court-Ordered $2 Million For Illegally Using Trump Foundation Funds December 10, 2019 Trump Ordered to Pay Eight Separate Charities $250,000 Each Remaining $1.8 Million in Trump Foundation Bank Account Disbursed Among Charities NEW YORK \u2013 New York Attorney General Letitia James today released the following statement after Donald J. Trump was forced to pay more than $2 million in court-ordered damages to eight different charities for illegally misusing charitable funds at the Trump Foundation for political purposes: \u201cNot only has the Trump Foundation shut down for its misconduct, but the president has been forced to pay $2 million for misusing charitable funds for his own political gain. Charities are not a means to an end, which is why these damages speak to the president\u2019s abuse of power and represent a victory for not-for-profits that follow the law. Funds have finally gone where they deserve \u2014 to eight credible charities. My office will continue to fight for accountability because no one is above the law \u2014 not a businessman, not a candidate for office, and not even the president of the United States.\u201d As part of a resolution of the lawsuit announced on November 7 th , Trump was ordered to pay $2 million, or $250,000, a piece to eight different charities. Those charities are Army Emergency Relief, the Children\u2019s Aid Society, Citymeals-on-Wheels, Give an Hour, Martha\u2019s Table, the United Negro College Fund, the United Way of National Capital Area, and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Additionally, Trump was forced to reimburse his namesake foundation $11,525 for sports paraphernalia and champagne purchased at a charity gala, which was added to $1,797,598.30 already in the foundation\u2019s bank account. The combined $1,809,123.30 was split evenly and recently transferred to the eight agreed upon charities. Each charity ended up receiving a total of $476,140.41. Additionally, as part of the settlement, Trump was required to agree to 19 admissions , acknowledging his personal misuse of funds at the Trump Foundation, and agreed to restrictions on future charitable service and ongoing reporting to the Office of the Attorney General, in the event he creates a new charity. The settlement also included mandatory training requirements for Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump, which the three children have already undergone.

False rumors were spread on social media in order to capitalize on heightened panic about pedophilia. Dan Evon Published Sept. 14, 2020 Reed Hastings spricht auf der re:publica 2015 am 05.05.2015 in Berlin..Copyright: re:publica/Gregor Fischer (Image courtesy of Wikipedia) Claim: Netflix CEO Reed Hastings was arrested on suspicion of possessing child pornography. Rating: False About this rating In September 2020, as social media users accused Netflix of promoting pedophilia due to a promotional poster for the award-winning French film \"Cuties,\" the website TorontoToday.net published an article claiming that Reed Hastings, the streaming service's CEO, had been arrested on suspicion of possession of child pornography: This is not a genuine news report. Hastings was not arrested by the FBI, and the accusations circulating on social media that the Netflix CEO was involved in child pornography are baseless and largely driven by pedophilia panic that consumed portions of the internet in 2020. Hasting is the CEO of one of the world's largest streaming services. If he truly had been arrested by the FBI, it would certainly warrant a press release from the FBI, and would undoubtedly make headlines in credible media outlets. However, the only source for this news appears to be random social media posts and an article published to a website with a history of spreading misinformation. TorontoToday.net is a relatively new website, but it has already been responsible for at least two viral hoaxes. Shortly after Black Panther actor Chadwick Boseman died from colon cancer, the website published a false report claiming that he had been poisoned. The website was also responsible for the false rumor that Russian President Vladimir Putin's daughter had died from a COVID-19 vaccine. The website deleted its false report about Hasting's arrest, but an archived version of the page can be found here . It appears that TorontoToday.net originally published this article under the headline \"Netflix CEO gets BUSTED with 13,000 files of CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.\" Then, the site updated the article to include the word \"reports\" before the headline, and deleted the original text of the article claiming a\nnature of the sexual abuse, and evidence of a \"clandestine drug lab\" discovered during the raid. The website Toronto Today has been responsible for multiple other misinformation hoaxes in the past few months, per Snopes and Lead Stories . Netflix did not respond to a request for comment on behalf of Hastings. Our rating: False Based on our research, the claim that Netflix CEO Reed Hastings was arrested for child pornography is FALSE. The claim appeared in an article from a website with a record of misinformation, according to other fact-checkers, and details from that article appeared to have been lifted from a report on an unrelated arrest of another individual in December 2019.

This fake report about the arrest of Netflix CEO Reed Hasting is just the latest in a long series of false rumors concerning pedophilia. In 2020, pedophilia panic consumed portions of the internet, in large part because these false rumors were being amplified by the growing QAnon conspiracy movement. In the last few months alone, we've covered false rumors about furniture stores trafficking children via large cabinets , department stores promoting pedophilia by selling shirts containing images of pizza , and the country of Greece classifying pedophilia as a disability. While pedophilia and sex trafficking are certainly real issues, the aforementioned stories are false. In fact, the National Human Trafficking Hotline released a statement saying that these pedophilia conspiracy theories were making it more difficult to help people who are actually in danger of being trafficked.

Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton, and Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard \u2014 over its recent release of the film \"Cuties,\" which has been criticized for sexualizing young girls. Amid the controversy, unfounded claims about Netflix CEO Reed Hastings have swirled on social media. Posts on Facebook and Instagram included a screenshot of a headline that claimed \"Netflix CEO gets BUSTED with 13,000 files of CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.\" The headline came from an article on the webpage Toronto Today. The story \u2014 which was archived on Sept. 12 prior to its removal from the site \u2014 claimed that Hastings was arrested at his home in California and faces \"11 charges related to the seizure of more than 13,000 files of graphic child pornography on his computer and various removable storage units.\" The users behind the posts did not respond to requests from USA TODAY for comment. Toronto Today denied being the original source of the false story, and noted in an email to USA TODAY that Netflix and Hastings have faced accusations of distributing child pornography since the release of \"Cuties.\" Story is false, details taken from an unrelated arrest of someone else in December 2019 The claims in the screenshots and the story from Toronto Today are false. No reputable media outlets reported the alleged arrest, and no law enforcement agencies \u2014 including the Federal Bureau of Investigations, which the article claims made the arrest \u2014 issued any press releases or statements to that effect. Numerous details in the article by Toronto Today appeared to be lifted from a report on ABC4 in December 2019, which detailed the arrest of Douglas Saltsman, a Utah CEO. Copied details include the number and content of the files, including the age of children and the nature of the sexual abuse, and evidence of a \"clandestine drug lab\" discovered during the raid.

This indicates that airborne transmission is a significant concern.\n\n2. **Effectiveness of Masks**: Research indicates that face masks can slow the spread of the virus when worn consistently, fit properly, and are used correctly. This suggests that while masks are effective in reducing transmission, they do not completely eliminate the risk.\n\n3. **Real-World Evidence**: Studies have shown that mask mandates are associated with reductions in COVID-19 growth rates and that wearing masks can decrease the probability of contracting the virus. For example, one study indicated that the probability of contracting COVID-19 was significantly lower for mask wearers compared to non-mask wearers.\n\n4. **Limitations**: Masks are not safe for everyone, and there are specific groups (like children under 2 or those with breathing difficulties) for whom masks should not be used. Additionally, masks alone are not a foolproof method to stop the spread; they are part of a broader strategy that includes social distancing and vaccination.\n\n5. **Public Health Recommendations**: The World Health Organization and other health authorities have recommended wearing masks as a measure to contain the spread of COVID-19, indicating that while masks are beneficial, they are part of a comprehensive approach to managing the pandemic.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement \"Wearing face masks will stop the spread of COVID-19\" is misleading. While masks significantly reduce the risk of transmission, they do not completely stop it.

Get answers to your questions about face masks, including how to use them properly. By Mayo Clinic Staff Oct. 29, 2025 The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly through the air when a person coughs, sneezes, sings, talks or breathes. Virus particles can drift in the air and be inhaled, especially in crowded places with poor airflow. Face masks or respirators are products that cover the nose, mouth and chin. Most research finds that these products can slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 when they are worn consistently, fit properly and are worn correctly. Wear a mask if you have symptoms of illness, if you are near others who are sick or if you're in a crowded indoor area. This is especially important if COVID-19 illness rates in your area are high. But face masks aren't safe for everyone. Don't put a mask on anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious or otherwise unable to remove the mask without help. And don't put masks on children younger than age 2. How do different types of masks work? Face masks differ in how well they filter air and fit on the face. Masks also differ on how easy or hard they are to breathe through. Some masks rely on fabric type, weave or density to filter the air. Other masks use a static charge, like the static charge that causes clothes to stick together in the dryer, to catch and hold the virus. Some masks use both strategies as well as others. Some masks have valves that make them easier to breathe through. But these masks don't filter the air the wearer breathes out. For this reason, masks with valves can't be used in some places. Respirators Masks called respirators have to meet specific standards and are designed to block almost all virus particles in the air. These masks include N95, FFP2, KN95 and other types. Respirators approved in the U.S. are called N95s. European respirators are called FFP2s and respirators from China are called KN95s. KN95 mask. An N95 mask. This type of mask may be available in a range of sizes and is meant to be adjusted to fit the face. These respirators have adjustable nosepieces and bands or ties. Many respirators can be used more\nof Jefferson et al [ 5 ] are at odds with clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of masks in protecting uninfected individuals from COVID-19 [ 6 , 7 ]. Clinical trials have also shown that masks reduce the risk of transmission of influenza or SARS-CoV-2 from previously infected individuals [ 8 ]. A key advantage of studies that are based on real-world data is their high external validity. As such, they can significantly complement the evidence from RCTs on the efficacy of face masks in protecting against ARIs. ARIs can be most effectively prevented at the population level when masks are worn by both susceptible and infectious individuals [ 8 , 9 ]. Following this line of reasoning, the World Health Organization issued a recommendation to publicly wear face masks to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 [ 10 ]. This recommendation has been adopted by countries around the world by implementing face mask mandates in 2020. As some countries and regions did not introduce any face mask policies, 3 studies used this fact to identify the causal effect of mandates on SARS-CoV-2 infections. Lyu and Wehby [ 11 ] conducted a natural experiment with real-world data to show that mandates in 15 states of the United States and Washington, District of Columbia, resulted in reductions in COVID-19 growth rates of up to 19%. Another study using real-world data from the Global COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS) found mask mandates in the United States to be related to decreases in daily new cases, daily new deaths, daily new hospital admissions, and increases in population shares wearing masks [ 12 ]. These findings are corroborated by Mitze et al [ 13 ], who, using a synthetic control design, found a 47% reduction in daily COVID-19 case growth rates attributable to a local mask mandate in Jena, Germany. In addition, 2 other population-level studies found evidence for a direct association between wearing face masks and COVID-19 outcomes.

However, given the inconclusive evidence from existing randomized controlled trials, evidence based on real-world data with high external validity is missing. Objective: To add real-world evidence, this study aims to examine whether mask mandates in 51 countries and mask recommendations in 10 countries increased self-reported face mask use and reduced SARS-CoV-2 reproduction numbers and COVID-19 case growth rates.

In public spaces, facemasks have played a crucial role in preventing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While facemasks were recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in June 2020, there is still a lack of scientific evidence regarding the epidemiological efficacy of facemasks against COVID-19 transmission .

About the study In the present study, researchers analyzed the efficiency of facemasks in curbing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the community as well as healthcare settings. The team performed a systematic review to identify relevant studies. A literature search was conducted by a medical librarian using Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science library between April and August 2020. The team subsequently deduplicated the citations using Covidence.org. Articles in only the English language were retrieved for the study, while all conference proceedings were excluded. The findings were reported as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. Three study team members reviewed the libraries to yield 1,732 articles. Among these, 61 full-text articles met the required criteria. Subsequently, a total of 13 studies were assessed in the study. The team estimated relative risk, frequencies, t-tests, and confidence intervals where necessary to calculate the variation between cohorts that did and did not report the usage of facemasks in the entire study group and community and healthcare settings. Results The study results showed that a total of 1,539 subjects were analyzed from 13 studies, including four community-based and nine healthcare-based studies. Among these, 243 subjects had SARS-CoV-2 infections, including 97 who did and 146 who did not wear facemasks. The team noted that the probability of contracting a COVID-19 disease was 7% for mask wearers and 52% for non-mask wearers.

Now he wants to wear masks.\" FACT CHECK: Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the top infectious disease experts in the country, and other public health experts initially told Americans not to wear surgical or N95 masks in the early days of what has become the COVID-19 pandemic. At the beginning of the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, as well as Fauci and other top experts, initially discouraged wearing masks because of concerns that masks and other personal protective equipment were in short supply for health care workers who needed them. Public health officials were also concerned wearing masks could have unintended consequences if people touched their face more often to adjust them or fail to keep social distancing. \"There was this feeling that there would be a shortage just for those who really need them very early on,\" Fauci said in a recent interview. \"That was the big deal. We didn't have enough PPE including masks. Then it became clear that cloth masks worked reasonably well. And therefore there was no more shortage. Then the different analyses, meta analyses and others came in that in fact, it does work.\" In early April, the CDC changed its recommendation about face coverings for the general public, based on evidence that a significant number of people who were asymptomatic or not yet feeling sick were transmitting the virus. Duke University researchers have also concluded that \"if 95 percent of people wear cloth masks when within 6 feet of other people in public, it will reduce COVID-19 transmission by at least 30 percent.\" Trump also said he thought Fauci was a Democrat, but Fauci is not registered as a member of any political party, according to D.C. voting records. --Stephanie Ebbs and Arielle Mitropoulos President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden participate in the final presidential debate at Belmont University, Oct. 22, 2020, in Nashville, Tenn.

At the start of the outbreak, Dr Anthony Fauci, the White House top infectious disease expert, recommended the US public didn't wear face coverings. But he says his early comments have been taken out of context, claiming he was initially cautious because there was a shortage of PPE for healthcare professionals. In early March, Dr Fauci said: \"It could lead to a shortage of masks for the people who really need it.\" By the end of March, Fauci said recommending face coverings outside a healthcare setting was under \"serious consideration\". Since April, Dr Fauci as well as the CDC have recommended the use of face coverings in certain settings to help slow the spread of coronavirus. Biden: \"We have 4% of the world's population, [but] 20% of the deaths\". Verdict: This is roughly correct. The US population is around 328 million, which is just over 4% of the 7.7 billion global population. There have been over 225,000 coronavirus deaths recorded in the US, according to the latest John Hopkins University data. The total number of deaths recorded worldwide is around 1,161,000. On this metric, the US accounts for over 19% of Covid-19 deaths worldwide, although the way countries record their figures varies considerably.

The team noted that the probability of contracting a COVID-19 disease was 7% for mask wearers and 52% for non-mask wearers. The relative risk of getting infected by SARS-CoV-2\nmay be able to catch droplets and sputum from a cough, but what is important is that SARS CoV-2 is predominantly distributed by aerosols that are much smaller than droplets. These aerosols are carried in the flow of air as someone breathes, and are significantly smaller than the pore / perforation size of common mask materials. All common types of masks also suffer from leakage through gaps around the edges, rendering them ineffective. Any higher grade mask (really designed for specialist industrial applications) that is not professionally fitted will also likely be ineffective due to leakage. The world-wide data that is now available from places where mask mandates were imposed consistently shows no measurable effect on infection spread. Added to that, inappropriate use of various computer modelling methods has resulted in misleading evidence being used to promote the efficacy of masks in preventing transmission, which they simply do not do.\u201d Co-chair Graham Stringer MP said : \u201cThe new Prime Minister and Health Secretary should not impose mask wearing again unless they can produce high quality evidence that the benefits far outweigh the harms to the individual and society as a whole.

{"claim": "Illegal drug, border crossings, and human smuggling activities have decreased in areas where barriers are deployed in the United States.", "label": "Not Enough Evidence", "result": {"response": "To assess the factual accuracy of the statement, we need to analyze the relevant knowledge points provided.\n\n1. **Border Barriers and Their Impact**: The knowledge indicates that barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border, such as fencing, are present in various areas. It mentions that these barriers are intended to reduce illegal crossings and drug trafficking.\n\n2. **Apprehensions and Drug Seizures**: The knowledge states that the operational capacity of border enforcement has increased due to the barriers, which has led to significant drug seizures (over a million pounds in a year). However, it does not provide specific data indicating a decrease in illegal drug activities or human smuggling specifically in areas with barriers.\n\n3. **Migration Patterns**: The knowledge also discusses how barriers have led to increased crossings in areas without fences, suggesting that while barriers may deter some crossings, they can also push migrants to more dangerous routes.\n\n4. **Human Trafficking Claims**: The statement claims a decrease in human trafficking, citing a 96% reduction. However, the knowledge does not provide evidence to support this specific figure or the claim that barriers have led to a decrease in human smuggling activities.\n\n5. **General Trends**: The knowledge mentions that illegal immigration continues despite barriers and that apprehensions have fluctuated over the years, indicating that the situation is complex and influenced by various factors.\n\nIn summary, while barriers are intended to reduce illegal crossings and drug trafficking, the knowledge does not provide conclusive evidence that these activities have indeed decreased in areas where barriers are deployed. The statement makes a definitive claim that is not fully supported by the provided information.\n\nBased on this analysis, the conclusion is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "to the end of his second term. [ 13 ] Description [ edit ] The 1,954-mile (3,145-kilometer) border between Mexico and the U.S. traverses a variety of terrain, including urban areas and deserts. [ 14 ] The border from the Gulf of Mexico to El Paso, Texas , follows the Rio Grande , a natural barrier. The barrier is on both urban and uninhabited sections of the border, where the most illegal crossings and drug trafficking have been observed in the past. These urban areas include San Diego , California, and El Paso, Texas. [ 15 ] The fencing includes a steel fence (varying in height between 18 and 27 feet (4.8 and 8.1 meters)) that divides the border towns of Nogales, Arizona , in the U.S. and Nogales, Sonora , in Mexico. [ 16 ] 97% of border apprehensions (foreign nationals caught in the U.S. illegally) by the Border Patrol in 2010 occurred at the southwest border. The number declined 61% from 1,189,000 in 2005 to 723,842 in 2008 to 463,000 in 2010. The decrease in apprehensions is the result of numerous factors, including changes in U.S. economic conditions and border enforcement efforts. Border apprehensions in 2010 were at their lowest level since 1972. [ 15 ] [ 17 ] Total apprehensions for 2017, 2018, and 2019 were 415,517, 521,090, and 977,509, respectively. [ 18 ] And while the barrier is along the border with Mexico, 80% of those apprehended are not Mexican. [ 19 ] As a result of the barrier, the number of people trying to cross in areas that have no fence, such as the Sonoran Desert and the Baboquivari Mountains in Arizona, has increased. [ 20 ] Such immigrants must cross 50 miles (80 km) of inhospitable terrain to reach the first road, which is in the Tohono O\u02bcodham Indian Reservation . [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Geography [ edit ] The Mexico\u2013U.S. border stretches from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the Gulf of Mexico in the east. Border states include the Mexican states of Baja California , Sonora , Chihuahua , Coahuila , Nuevo Le\u00f3n , and Tamaulipas and the U.S. states of California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. [ 22 ] U.S. state Border length Mexican states California 140.4 miles (226.0 km) Baja California Arizona 372.5 miles (599.5 km) Baja California, Sonora New Mexico 179.5 miles (288.9 km) Sonora, Chihuahua\nThat\u2019s fantastic. That\u2019s fantastic. So, it\u2019s a great \u2014 it\u2019s a great feeling to have closed up the border. Now people come in if they come in through merit, if they come in legally \u2014 but they don\u2019t come in like they used to. And human trafficking is \u2014 I think we\u2019re down 96 percent or something. It\u2019s been incredible. Mark, why don\u2019t you say a few words, please. ACTING COMMISSIONER MORGAN: Yes, sir. So, thank you. So first of all, what you see behind me has saved American lives. Every single bit of concrete and steel that goes into the ground, the operational capacity of the men and women you\u2019re seeing right here goes exponentially higher to stop dangerous things and people from coming into this country. Drugs \u2014 drugs alone \u2014 what this wall does is it helps us shape the behavior of the cartels. It puts us in an offensive position, just like the President said. Because of that, this year \u2014 year, to date \u2014 we\u2019ve seized over a million pounds of drugs. Think about that: this year, to date, a million pounds of drugs. And this wall is helping shape the behavior so that we can get better at doing that. We talked about criminals. We apprehend thousands of criminals every single year. Think about that. You know, a lot of these individuals are violent criminals. Because of this wall, we\u2019re able to apprehend and stop these criminals from coming into this country to repeat their offenses. So we have fewer victims of United States citizens because of the wall, because of what this President has provided us. Let\u2019s talk about gangs. Every single year, we stop hundreds and hundreds of gangs from pouring into this country \u2014 like MS-13, whose motto is \u201cRape, Kill, and Control.\u201d That\u2019s their motto: \u201cRape, Kill, and Control.\u201d Just recently \u2014 it wasn\u2019t that long ago \u2014 they used machetes to hack up their victims, and they actually leave them decapitated. That\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about when we\u2019re talking about what this tool provides us. And then, of course, illegal immigration: Even during the height of a global pandemic, illegal immigration continues. And they allow themselves to be put in stash houses that are unsanitary, unsafe. They\u2019re put in tractor trailers for days. I mean, there\u2019s COVID \u2014 that\u2019s like a COVID petri dish. But yet, they\u2019re coming across.\nthere have been more military operations at the border. The administration has also increased the number of expedited removals. Biden has tried to work with Congress to overhaul the immigration system, but a majority of Republican lawmakers have not moved forward with the Senate $118 billion border agreement . Claim 2: Biden\u2019s executive order has reduced illegal migration Unable to act more broadly without Congress, Biden has implemented a handful of policies aimed at reducing the number of crossings, and asylum claims, at the Southern border over the last few months. One June 4, Biden issued executive actions severely restricted asylum claims between ports of entry , blocking most unauthorized migrants from attaining asylum. The Biden administration has said that since the policy went into effect, there has been a 40% decrease in unauthorized crossings. But these types of dips are not surprising. Historically, these policies deter migrants for a short period of time, but those numbers tend to go up, according to an analysis by the D.C.-based Washington Office on Latin America. Migrants tend to go into a wait-and-see period before crossing again. Many migrants who have talked to NPR in Mexican border communities have said they will attempt to cross, despite the policies . Of note: Biden\u2019s asylum restrictions mirror those implemented by Trump, but that Biden lifted in 2021 . Claim 3: Migrants crossing are committing crimes There is no doubt that some migrants who have crossed the border without authorization have committed crimes. This has been something Republicans have been hammering on recently, after two Venezuelan immigrants were charged with capital murder for killing a 12-year-old girl. But data shows a vast majority of immigrants do not commit crimes. In fact, a study by Northwestern University examining a 150-year period found that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than people born in the U.S. Facebook Flipboard Email\nnow you're in a situation where there are 40 percent fewer people coming across the border illegally.\" Mostly True. The Department of Homeland Security announced that illegal immigration encounters dropped by 40 percent, to fewer than 2,400 each day , in the weeks after Biden announced a policy largely barring asylum access for people entering the U.S. at the southern border. The policy was announced June 4. But immigration experts caution that it's difficult to pinpoint a single reason for any change in border crossings. For example, other factors, such as hot weather , can affect migration patterns. Since the policy was announced only a few weeks ago, it's unclear whether the drop in illegal immigration will continue . Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, associate policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, told PolitiFact the policy could have a short-term deterrent effect. But Adam Isacson, defense oversight director at the Washington Office on Latin America told PolitiFact, that no crackdown in the past decade has had a lasting impact . Trump's falsehoods about his and Biden's economic achievements Trump: \"I gave you the largest tax cut in history.\" False. When it was passed in 2017, Trump's tax cut was, in inflation-adjusted dollars, the fourth-largest since 1940. And as a percentage of gross domestic product, it ranked seventh in history, according to figures published by the Treasury Department. Trump: \"The only jobs (Biden) created are for illegal immigrants and bounceback jobs, bounce back from the COVID.\" False. Since Biden took office in early 2021, the number of foreign-born Americans who are employed has risen by about 5.6 million. But over the same time period, the number of native-born Americans employed has increased by almost 7.4 million. (There are many more native-born Americans than foreign-born Americans, so on a percentage basis, the increase for foreign-born Americans is about 22 percent, compared with 6 percent for native-born Americans.) It's also wrong to say that all the foreign-born employment gains (much less all the employment gains, period) stem from migrants here illegally. The data for foreign-born Americans includes anyone born outside the U.S., including immigrants who have been in the United States legally for decades. Employment on Biden's watch passed its prepandemic level by June 2022, about a year-and-a-half into his term. Since then, the U.S. economy has created an additional 6.2 million jobs. Biden's economic talking points mostly hit the mark Biden: \"Black unemployment is the\nThat\u2019s fantastic. That\u2019s fantastic. So, it\u2019s a great \u2014 it\u2019s a great feeling to have closed up the border. Now people come in if they come in through merit, if they come in legally \u2014 but they don\u2019t come in like they used to.

[ 34 ] [ 35 ] Background Further information: United States presidential election \u00a7 Procedure The incumbent in 2016, Barack Obama . His second term expired at noon on January 20, 2017. President Barack Obama , a Democrat and former U.S. senator from Illinois , was ineligible to seek reelection to a third term due to the restrictions of the American presidential term limits established by the Twenty-second Amendment . [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Both the Democratic and Republican parties, as well as third parties such as the Green and Libertarian parties, held a series of presidential primary elections and caucuses that took place between February and June 2016, staggered among the 50 states, the District of Columbia , and U.S. territories . This nominating process was also an indirect election, where voters cast ballots for a slate of delegates to a political party's nominating convention , who in turn elected their party's presidential nominee. Speculation about the 2016 campaign began almost immediately following the 2012 campaign, with New York magazine declaring that the race had begun in an article published on November 8, two days after the 2012 election. [ 38 ] On the same day, Politico released an article predicting that the 2016 general election would be between Clinton and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush , while an article in The New York Times named New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Senator Cory Booker from New Jersey as potential candidates. [ 39 ] [ 40 ] Nominations Republican Party Primaries Main article: 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries With seventeen major candidates entering the race, starting with Ted Cruz on March 23, 2015, this was the largest presidential primary field for any political party in American history, [ 41 ] before being overtaken by the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries. [ 42 ] Prior to the Iowa caucuses on February 1, 2016, Perry, Walker, Jindal, Graham, and Pataki withdrew due to low polling numbers. Despite leading many polls in Iowa, Trump came in second to Cruz, after which Huckabee, Paul, and Santorum withdrew due to poor performances at the ballot box. Following a sizable victory for Trump in the New Hampshire primary , Christie, Fiorina, and Gilmore abandoned\nof weeks later, Trump said that he \u201cgenerally speaking would not\u201d use the Comstock Act to outlaw the shipment of abortion pills.

Salman Ghazi, managing director of Iqra Education Foundation, which provides religious curriculum to nearly 200 regular schools run by Muslim managements, said that the low participation of Muslims in higher education has its roots in the partition of the country. \"There was discrimination against Muslims in the aftermath. The tendency among young men was that higher education was a waste of time and money because they faced odds while aspiring for government jobs,\" said Ghazi. However, a Maharashtra cadre officer from the 1979 IAS batch said that low participation of Muslims in the exams, rather than discrimination, was the cause for their low representation in the services. \"As a Muslim, I never faced discrimination. Muslims were around 3.5% of the successful candidates at that time. I do not know whether it is true today, but the percentage of Muslim candidates was lower. However, the success rate for Muslims was higher. If there was discrimination, this would not be the case,\" said the former bureaucrat. There is also a consensus that the community was turning to higher education in larger numbers. \"Globalisation has reduced religious discrimination, and there are many Muslims in the corporate world in India. I think there has been a paradigm shift in the attitude to higher education. Wealthy Muslims are establishing schools. Even the Ulema - the clergy - is promoting schools rather than madrassas.

After the result was declared, many students came forward saying that there are discrepancies in the evaluation process. One student also filed a petition in the Bombay High Court after receiving zero marks in the NEET 2020 exams, even though while checking her OMR sheet, she had calculated herself getting at least 600 out of 720 marks. Another student has pointed out that as per the scanned OMR sheet uploaded by NTA, he has scored a perfect 720 out of 720, but according to the final scorecard, he scored a mere 212 in the NEET 2020 exams, which is highly unlikely. This year, the NEET 2020 exam result was released on October 16 and two students ended up scoring full marks i.e. 720 out of 720 in the medical entrance examination.

{"claim": "President Ferdinand Marcos and Dr. Jose Rizal established and founded the WORLD BANK and International Monetary Fund.", "label": "Refuted", "result": {"response": "To assess the factual accuracy of the statement that \"President Ferdinand Marcos and Dr. Jose Rizal established and founded the WORLD BANK and International Monetary Fund,\" we need to analyze the key points from the provided knowledge.\n\n1. **World Bank and IMF Origins**: The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were established in 1944 during the Bretton Woods Conference, which took place in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, USA. The founding members included representatives from 44 countries, primarily from the Allied nations after World War II. Notably, the key figures involved in the establishment of these institutions were not Ferdinand Marcos or Jose Rizal.\n\n2. **Ferdinand Marcos**: Ferdinand Marcos was the President of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986. His presidency is known for martial law and various controversies, but he was not involved in the founding of the World Bank or the IMF.\n\n3. **Jose Rizal**: Dr. Jose Rizal was a Filipino nationalist and revolutionary who lived in the late 19th century (1861-1896). He is known for his writings that inspired the Philippine revolution against Spanish colonial rule. Rizal died long before the World Bank and IMF were established and had no role in their creation.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement is factually incorrect. Neither Ferdinand Marcos nor Jose Rizal had any role in the establishment of the World Bank or the IMF.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "edit ] Okonjo-Iweala, at the 2004 Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group Okonjo-Iweala had a 25-year career at the World Bank in Washington, D.C. , as a development economist and rose to the No. 2 position of Managing Director, Operations. [ 23 ] As Managing Director, she had oversight responsibility for the World Bank \u2019s $81 billion operational portfolio in Africa, South Asia , Europe , and Central Asia. Okonjo-Iweala spearheaded several World Bank initiatives to assist low-income countries during the 2008\u20132009 food crises and later during the financial crisis. In 2010, she chaired the IDA replenishment, the World Bank\u2019s successful drive to raise $49.3 billion in grants and low-interest credit for the world's poorest country. [ 24 ] During her time at the World Bank, she was also a member of the Commission on Effective Development Cooperation with Africa, which was set up by Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen and held meetings between April and October 2008.

She was the first woman to hold both positions. During her first tenure as Finance Minister in the administration of President Olusegun Obasanjo , she spearheaded negotiations with the Paris Club that led to the elimination of US$30 billion of Nigeria's debt, including the outright cancellation of US$18 billion. [ 26 ] In 2003, she led efforts to improve Nigeria\u2019s macroeconomic management including the implementation of an oil-price based fiscal rule. Revenues accruing above a reference benchmark oil price were saved in a special account, the \"Excess Crude Account,\" which helped to reduce macroeconomic volatility. [ 27 ] Okonjo-Iweala was also instrumental in helping Nigeria obtain its first ever sovereign credit rating (of BB minus) from Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor\u2019s in 2006. [ 22 ] She also introduced the practice of publishing the federal, state, and local government shares of revenue from the country\u2019s federal account. That action went a long way in increasing transparency in governance at all levels of government, particularly the sub-national level.

This implies a formal religious endorsement and a requirement for divine approval for NASA's operations.\n\n2. **Analyzing the First Part**: The claim that \"NASA always receives blessings from the Pope\" suggests a consistent and formal relationship between NASA and the Vatican. While there have been instances where the Pope has expressed interest in space exploration and has met with astronauts, there is no official requirement or practice that mandates NASA to seek blessings from the Pope for every mission.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Second Part**: The assertion that \"God\u2019s permission must be sought before a space mission\" implies a religious obligation that NASA must fulfill. NASA is a scientific organization that operates based on empirical evidence and scientific principles, not religious mandates. There is no formal process within NASA that involves seeking divine permission for its missions.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Both parts of the statement suggest a religious framework that does not align with the operational practices of NASA. NASA operates independently of religious institutions and does not require blessings or divine permission for its missions.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the statement is not accurate.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 0, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.6}
{"claim": "Joe Biden is for open borders, sanctuary cities, free lawyers and health care for illegal immigrants.", "label": "Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking", "result": {"response": "To assess the factual accuracy of the statement \"Joe Biden is for open borders, sanctuary cities, free lawyers and health care for illegal immigrants,\" we need to break down the components of the statement based on the provided knowledge points.\n\n1. **Open Borders**: The knowledge indicates that while unauthorized crossings have hit record highs under Biden, the border is not \"open.\" In fact, it is described as being more reinforced than ever, with increased military operations and expedited removals. Therefore, the claim that Biden supports \"open borders\" is inaccurate.\n\n2. **Sanctuary Cities**: The knowledge does not specifically address Biden's stance on sanctuary cities. However, it is known that Biden has generally supported more lenient immigration policies compared to previous administrations, which may imply some level of support for sanctuary cities, but this is not explicitly confirmed in the provided information.\n\n3. **Free Lawyers for Illegal Immigrants**: The knowledge does not provide any information regarding Biden's position on providing free legal representation for illegal immigrants. This aspect of the statement cannot be verified based on the provided knowledge.\n\n4. **Health Care for Illegal Immigrants**: The knowledge mentions that Biden has stated that people who are sick should not go uncovered, implying a level of support for health care access for undocumented immigrants. However, it clarifies that the candidates were asked if their health care plans would provide coverage for immigrants in the country illegally, and it did not specify that this coverage would be free. Therefore, the claim that Biden supports \"free health care\" for illegal immigrants is misleading.\n\nIn summary, the statement contains several inaccuracies:\n- Biden does not support open borders.\n- The claim about sanctuary cities is not directly addressed.\n- There is no evidence provided regarding free lawyers.\n- The health care claim is misleading as it does not clarify the nature of the coverage.\n\nGiven this analysis, the statement is largely inaccurate.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "Analysis: Fact-checking the CNN Trump-Biden debate | PBS News Support PBS News Your generous monthly contribution\u2014 or whatever you can give\u2014will help secure our future.

Trump's outlandish immigration claim Trump says Biden \"allowed millions of people to come in here from prisons, jails and mental institutions.\" Pants on Fire! Immigration officials arrested about 103,700 noncitizens with criminal convictions (whether in the U.S. or abroad) from fiscal years 2021 to 2024, federal data shows. That accounts for people stopped at and between ports of entry. Not everyone was let in. The term \"noncitizens\" includes people who may have had legal immigration status in the U.S. but were not U.S. citizens. The data reflects the people that the federal government knows about, but it's inexhaustive. However, immigration experts said despite the data's limitations, there is no evidence to support Trump's statement. Biden's close to the mark about immigration reductions Biden: \"I've changed (the law) in the way that now you're in a situation where there are 40 percent fewer people coming across the border illegally.\" Mostly True.

He also said many falsehoods about the current state of immigration. 4 takeaways from the first presidential debate Meanwhile, Biden attempted to explain what he would do to continue lowering the number of migrants crossing illegally, despite that number hitting an all-time high during his tenure. Here are three fact checks of claims made during the debate related to immigration: Claim 1: The U.S. Southern border is open This is a talking point used often by Republicans when referring to Biden\u2019s handling of the U.S.-Mexico border. \u201cHe decided to open up our border, open up our country,\u201d Trump said of Biden during the debate. But this is not accurate. It is true that under Biden, unauthorized crossings hit a record high, oftentimes overwhelming certain border communities and straining its resources . But the border is not \"open.\" In fact, it is arguably more reinforced than ever. The federal government has added more sections of the U.S. Southern border walls, and there have been more military operations at the border. The administration has also increased the number of expedited removals. Biden has tried to work with Congress to overhaul the immigration system, but a majority of Republican lawmakers have not moved forward with the Senate $118 billion border agreement .

Buttigieg : \"Our country is healthier when everybody is healthier. And remember, we\u2019re talking about something people are getting a \u2014 given a chance to buy into. In the same way that there are undocumented immigrants in my community who pay, they pay sales taxes, they pay property taxes directly or indirectly. This is not about a handout. This is an insurance program. And we do ourselves no favor by having 11 million undocumented people in our country be unable to access health care.\" Guthrie then asked Biden to comment. Biden : \"You cannot let \u2014 as the mayor said, you cannot let people who are sick, no matter where they come from, no matter what their status, go uncovered. You can\u2019t do that. It\u2019s just going to be taken care of, period. You have to. It\u2019s the humane thing to do. \"But here\u2019s the deal. The deal is that he\u2019s right about three things. Number one, they in fact contribute to the well-being of the country, but they also \u2014 for example, they\u2019ve increased the lifespan of Social Security because they\u2019re \u2014 they have a job. They\u2019re paying the Social Security tax. That\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s increased the lifespan. They would do the same thing in terms of reducing the overall cost of health care by them being able to be treated and not wait until they\u2019re in extremis.\" No other candidate commented on that question. So all candidates raised their hands affirming they\u2019d have a plan that would offer coverage for immigrants in the country illegally. But the question did not directly ask if coverage would be free. Buttigieg specifically said people would buy the coverage, and that it was \"not about a handout.\" Biden in his answer spoke about the contributions of immigrants in the country illegally \u2014 and said that if they had health care coverage, they\u2019d be reducing the cost of the overall health care system. Our ruling A Trump re-election campaign ad said Democratic presidential candidates \"support giving illegal immigrants free healthcare at our expense.\" This is misleading. The claim is based on a raise-your-hand type of question in a June debate. Candidates were asked if their health care plans would provide coverage for immigrants in the country illegally. All candidates raised their hand. But the question did not ask if the coverage would be for free.\nAP FACT CHECK: Examining claims from the last Trump-Biden debate | PBS News Support PBS News Your generous monthly contribution\u2014 or whatever you can give\u2014will help secure our future.

President Donald Trump's first line of the night, about COVID-19 deaths, was false and set the tone as he and Democratic rival Joe Biden unleashed a torrent of claims in their last presidential debate . Trump misrepresented the reality of the pandemic in myriad and familiar ways, insisting against obvious reality that the pandemic is drawing to a close. He also boasted about \"clean\" facilities at the border for migrant children, ignoring the filthy conditions under which they were held in 2018. Biden, at times, was selective on the coronavirus and other matters, at one point stating that no one under Obamacare lost private health coverage. Millions did. A look at how some of the statements on the stage in Nashville, Tennessee, compared with the facts: CORONAVIRUS TRUMP: \"We're rounding the turn. We're rounding the corner. It's going away.\" THE FACTS: No, the coronavirus isn't going away. It's coming back. New cases are on the rise toward their summer peak. Deaths have also been increasing. According to data through Oct. 21 from Johns Hopkins University, the seven-day rolling average for daily new cases in the U.S. rose over the past two weeks from over 42,300 on Oct. 7 to nearly 60,000 on Oct. 21. In that time the seven-day rolling average for daily new deaths in the U.S. rose from 695 to 757. ___ TRUMP: \"All he does is talk about shutdowns. But forget about him. His Democrat governors Cuomo in New York, you look at what's going on in California, you look at Pennsylvania, North Carolina. Democrats \u2014 Democrats all. They're shut down so tight, and they're dying.\" BIDEN: \"Look at the states that are having such a spike in the coronavirus.

However, they are not effective against aerosols or smaller particles, which are significant in the transmission of viruses like SARS-CoV-2. This suggests that ordinary masks may not be effective against very small particles, such as those found in wildfire smoke.\n\n2. **CDC Guidance**: While the knowledge does not explicitly mention CDC guidance on masks and wildfire smoke, it does highlight that masks are not effective against smaller aerosols. This implies that if the CDC were to announce that ordinary masks do not protect against wildfire smoke, it would align with the understanding that these masks cannot filter out small particulate matter.\n\n3. **General Consensus on Mask Use**: The knowledge also discusses the ineffectiveness of masks in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses, which could extend to their effectiveness against other small particles, such as those from smoke.\n\nGiven these points, the statement that the CDC announces that ordinary masks will do nothing to protect against wildfire smoke because they do not catch small particles is likely true, as it aligns with the understanding of mask efficacy against small particles.\n\nThus, the conclusion is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"True\"\n}\n```", "answer": "True"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "may be able to catch droplets and sputum from a cough, but what is important is that SARS CoV-2 is predominantly distributed by aerosols that are much smaller than droplets. These aerosols are carried in the flow of air as someone breathes, and are significantly smaller than the pore / perforation size of common mask materials. All common types of masks also suffer from leakage through gaps around the edges, rendering them ineffective. Any higher grade mask (really designed for specialist industrial applications) that is not professionally fitted will also likely be ineffective due to leakage. The world-wide data that is now available from places where mask mandates were imposed consistently shows no measurable effect on infection spread. Added to that, inappropriate use of various computer modelling methods has resulted in misleading evidence being used to promote the efficacy of masks in preventing transmission, which they simply do not do.\u201d Co-chair Graham Stringer MP said : \u201cThe new Prime Minister and Health Secretary should not impose mask wearing again unless they can produce high quality evidence that the benefits far outweigh the harms to the individual and society as a whole.

Steps you can take When choosing to wear a mask, choose the most protective type you can. Determine how well it fits. Gaps can let air leak in and out. Check for gaps by cupping your hands around the outside edges of the mask. If the mask has a good fit, you will feel warm air come through the front of the mask and may be able to see the mask material move in and out with each breath.

Clinical trials have also shown that masks reduce the risk of transmission of influenza or SARS-CoV-2 from previously infected individuals [ 8 ]. A key advantage of studies that are based on real-world data is their high external validity. As such, they can significantly complement the evidence from RCTs on the efficacy of face masks in protecting against ARIs. ARIs can be most effectively prevented at the population level when masks are worn by both susceptible and infectious individuals [ 8 , 9 ]. Following this line of reasoning, the World Health Organization issued a recommendation to publicly wear face masks to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 [ 10 ]. This recommendation has been adopted by countries around the world by implementing face mask mandates in 2020. As some countries and regions did not introduce any face mask policies, 3 studies used this fact to identify the causal effect of mandates on SARS-CoV-2 infections. Lyu and Wehby [ 11 ] conducted a natural experiment with real-world data to show that mandates in 15 states of the United States and Washington, District of Columbia, resulted in reductions in COVID-19 growth rates of up to 19%. Another study using real-world data from the Global COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS) found mask mandates in the United States to be related to decreases in daily new cases, daily new deaths, daily new hospital admissions, and increases in population shares wearing masks [ 12 ]. These findings are corroborated by Mitze et al [ 13 ], who, using a synthetic control design, found a 47% reduction in daily COVID-19 case growth rates attributable to a local mask mandate in Jena, Germany. In addition, 2 other population-level studies found evidence for a direct association between wearing face masks and COVID-19 outcomes. Controlling for time-constant unobserved heterogeneity, Rader et al [ 14 ] report decreasing growth rates of COVID-19 cases with increasing state-specific proportions of face mask wearers at the US state level. Leffler et al [ 15 ] use a cross-sectional design across 196 countries and observe that longer durations of face mask use are inversely associated with COVID-19 mortality.

Verification To confirm the veracity of the claim, Dubawa surfed the website of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Nigeria\u2019s apex monetary authority, for relevant (legislative) documents. Section 21 of the CBN Act 2007 deals with tampering with, and trading, in Naira notes. The Act prescribes \u201cimprisonment for a term not less than six months or to a fine not less than N50,000 or to both such fine and imprisonment for anyone guilty of \u201cspraying of, dancing or matching on the Naira or any note issued by the Bank during social occasions\u201d. The full section is reproduced below: \u201c21. \u2014\u2014(1) A person who tampers with a coin or note issued by the Bank is guilty of an offence and shall on notes and coins imprisonment for a term not less than six months or to a fine not less than N50,000 or to both such fine and imprisonment. (2) A coin or note shall be deemed to have been tampered with if the coin or note has been impaired, diminished or lightened otherwise than by fair wear and tear or has been defaced by stumping, engraving, mutilating, piercing, stapling, writing, tearing, soiling, squeezing or any other form of deliberate and willful abuse whether the coin or note has or has not been thereby diminished or lightened. (3) For the avoidance of doubt, spraying of, dancing or matching on the Naira or any note issued by the Bank during social occasions or otherwise howsoever shall constitute an abuse and defacing of the Naira or such note and shall be punishable under Sub-section (1) of this section. (4) It shall also be an offence punishable under Sub-section (1) of this section for any person to hawk, sell or otherwise trade in the Naira notes, coins or any other note issued by the Bank. (5) In this section\u2014\u2014 (i) \u201cMatching\u201d includes spreading scattering or littering of any surface with any Naira notes or coins and stepping thereon, regardless of the value, volume, occasion or intent. (ii) \u201cSpraying\u201d includes adorning, decorating or spraying anything or any person or any part of any person or the person of another with Naira notes or coins or sprinkling or sticking of the Naira notes or coins in a similar manner regardless of the amount, occasion or the intent.\u201d The law became necessary in a bid by the CBN to minimize \u201ccosts in printing\nSection 21(3) of the CBN Act specifically forbids Nigerians to spray or throw the national currency at social occasions.\nThe Legalities of Spraying Naira Notes in Nigeria top of page Search In today's society, the act of spraying naira notes during celebrations has become a common practice, often associated with festivity and jubilation. However, beyond the cultural significance, there lies a legal dimension that many individuals may not be aware of. As we delve into the legality of spraying naira notes in Nigeria, we uncover insights that shed light on the implications of this seemingly harmless tradition. Understanding the Legal Framework Under Nigerian law, specifically the Central Bank of Nigeria Act 2007, Section 21 sub-section 1, it is stated that \"A person who tampers with a coin or note lawfully issued by the Bank is guilty of an offense and shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment.\" This provision puts into perspective the seriousness with which the defacement of the naira currency is viewed in the country. While the act of spraying money is deeply rooted in cultural practices, it is crucial to recognize that these traditions must align with legal statutes to avoid unintended consequences. The misuse of naira notes through spraying not only disrespects the legal tender but also contributes to the devaluation of the currency and undermines the integrity of the financial system. Site Activity Insights Analyzing site activity data on our platform revealed a growing interest in legal issues surrounding currency handling and cultural practices. This trend underscores the need for clarity and education on the subject to ensure compliance with the law while preserving cultural heritage. Enforcement and Penalties Enforcement of laws regarding the handling of naira notes is essential to maintain the integrity of the currency and the financial system as a whole. Individuals found guilty of defacing or mishandling naira notes could face penalties, including fines and imprisonment, as stipulated by the relevant laws. As casual readers, it is important to be mindful of our actions and their legal implications, even in moments of celebration and joy. Respecting the legal tender not only upholds the law but also safeguards the value of the naira for future generations. Conclusion In conclusion, the practice of spraying naira notes, while culturally significant, must be approached with an understanding of the legal framework governing currency in Nigeria. By respecting the legal tender and adhering to the provisions set forth by the Central Bank of Nigeria, we contribute to upholding the value and integrity of our national\nof any person or the person of another with Naira notes or coins or sprinkling or sticking of the Naira notes or coins in a similar manner regardless of the amount, occasion or the intent.\u201d The law became necessary in a bid by the CBN to minimize \u201ccosts in printing and minting currency.\u201d Enforcement of the Act Though the law has been in place since 2007, there has been no report of arrests or prosecution for spraying of Naira notes at social events, despite being a prevalent practice in the country. The only reported cases of arrest have been about those hawking the notes, not those spraying. Few instances of the reports of such arrests can be found here , here and here Also, the CBN\u2019s \u201cClean Notes Policy\u201d campaign to discourage the practice has not yielded much results. A report by The Nation states that enforcing the law has been difficult because it \u201chas had to contend with Nigerians\u2019 culture of spraying money at social events\u201d. Even former president Olusegun Obasanjo who signed the bill into law was caught, with pictures, a situation which led to criticisms against the central bank for failing to enforce its laws, according to a Premium Times report. Also, controversial former Kogi senator, Dino Melaye, was seen on video spraying notes on a singer, Yinka Ayefele, at his mother\u2019s burial in 2019. In 2018, the CBN and commercial banks announced they have resolved to introduce mobile courts to arrest currency hawkers and people who spray at parties. \u201cIn the near future, there is going to be an introduction of mobile courts to handle such situations and those caught would be dealt with on the spot,\u201d Hamda Ambah, managing director, FSDH Merchant Bank, said on behalf of the Bankers Committee. Two years later, nothing has been heard about the proposed mobile court. The CBN did not respond to Dubawa \u2018s email asking for the progress so far made in terms of the enforcement of the Act since 2007. Conclusion Spraying of Naira notes at social occasions or any other place is an offense, according to the CBN Act 2007. Section 21 of the Act prescribes a fine of N50,000 or six months imprisonment or both for anyone found culpable. However, there is no evidence anyone has been arrested and prosecuted for the offence, despite its prevalence in the country.

Here, he walks onstage during a rally on July 3 in Sarasota, Fla. Jason Behnken/AP Former President Donald Trump is suing Facebook, Twitter and Google's YouTube over their suspensions of his accounts after a mob of his supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol in January.

This suggests a significant atmospheric phenomenon that could be due to natural events such as wildfires, sunsets, or other environmental factors.\n\n2. **Key Points from Knowledge**: \n   - The sky can change colors due to various reasons, including atmospheric conditions, pollution, and natural disasters.\n   - Wildfires, particularly in the western United States, can cause the sky to appear orange or red due to smoke and particulate matter.\n   - Sunsets can also create vibrant colors in the sky, including shades of orange and red.\n\n3. **Contextual Analysis**: \n   - There have been instances in recent years where wildfires have caused the sky to appear orange or red in parts of the United States, particularly in states like California and Oregon.\n   - Additionally, atmospheric conditions can lead to dramatic sunsets that result in similar color changes.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the context of recent environmental events, it is plausible that the sky has indeed turned orange to blood red in several parts of the United States. This aligns with known phenomena related to wildfires and atmospheric conditions.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the statement is accurate.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"True\"\n}\n```", "answer": "True"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 0, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.6}
{"claim": "The NFL, NBA and MLB have Tax-Exempt status.", "label": "Refuted", "result": {"response": "To assess the factual accuracy of the statement \"The NFL, NBA and MLB have Tax-Exempt status,\" we need to analyze the relevant knowledge points regarding tax-exempt status and the specific leagues mentioned.\n\n1. **Understanding Tax-Exempt Status**: Tax-exempt status typically refers to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, which is generally reserved for charitable organizations. However, some other types of organizations can also be tax-exempt under different sections.\n\n2. **NFL, NBA, and MLB**: \n   - The **NFL** (National Football League) is a professional American football league. It was previously classified as a tax-exempt organization but lost that status in 2015.\n   - The **NBA** (National Basketball Association) is a professional basketball league. It is not tax-exempt; it operates as a for-profit entity.\n   - The **MLB** (Major League Baseball) is a professional baseball league. Similar to the NFL, it was previously classified as a tax-exempt organization but has since transitioned to a for-profit model.\n\n3. **Current Status**: As of the latest information, none of these leagues maintain a tax-exempt status. The NFL and MLB have both moved away from tax-exempt status, and the NBA has never been tax-exempt.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement that \"The NFL, NBA and MLB have Tax-Exempt status\" is inaccurate.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "changes, beginning in 2025, unless otherwise noted.

It primarily discusses Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court and her remarks during that process. There is no mention of Ginsburg's views on pedophilia or any related topics.\n\n2. **Contextual Understanding**: Ruth Bader Ginsburg was known for her advocacy for gender equality and civil rights. Any claim attributing a statement like \"Pedophilia is good for the children\" to her would be highly controversial and likely to be widely reported if true. Given her reputation and the serious nature of such a claim, it would be expected that credible sources would have documented such a statement if it were made.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Since the knowledge provided does not support the statement and given the nature of the claim, it is reasonable to conclude that the statement is false. There is no evidence or credible source that supports the assertion that Ruth Bader Ginsburg made such a statement.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "Updated Jan. 16, 2026 Maskot / Getty Images/Maskot Are You The 'Food Parent'?

Barrett began her speech acknowledging the shoes she is being asked to fill, calling Ginsburg a \"woman of enormous talent and consequence\" who not only cracked, but \"smashed\" glass ceilings and won the admiration of women around the world. The judge said she has been inspired by Ginsburg's close relationship with Antonin Scalia, the late conservative justice for whom Barrett once clerked. \"His judicial philosophy is mine, too,\" Barrett said as Scalia's wife and son looked on from the audience. \"A judge must apply the law as written. Judges are not policymakers and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold.\" In introducing his nominee, Trump linked the weight of a Supreme Court appointment with a message he touts on the campaign trail, calling \"law and order\" the foundation of the U.S. justice system. \"The stakes for our country are incredibly high,\" Trump said. \"Rulings that the Supreme Court will issue in the coming years will decide the survival of our Second Amendment, our religious liberty, our public safety and so much more.

Barrett also seemed to acknowledge the charged political moment she's stepping into, saying she has \"no illusions that the road ahead for me will be easy.\" \"The president has nominated me to serve on the United States Supreme Court, and that institution belongs to all of us.

The country\u2019s journey into nationhood was herald by high hopes and prospects for national unity, peace and development. This was because of its vast human and material resources, and land mass. Nigeria is dominantly made of three prominent regions: the North (Hausa Fulani), the West (Yorubas) and the East (Igbos) with minorities in other regions. The military took over the leadership of the country barely six years into her independence as a nation. The military held sway for twenty nine years out of the ininitial forty years of the country\u2019s post independence history before her return to civil rule in 1999. The county is still been confronted with challenges on all fronts ranging from insecurity and insurgency, economy, political uncertainty, electoral malpractices, high rate of unemployment, poor infrastructure amongst others. Literature have been skewed toward military intervention in politics as the root cause of the challenges bedeviling the country more than two decades after her return to civil rule. The study employed both quantitative and qualitative data. The study analysed the history of military rule in Nigeria and interrogated the crux of the military institution. It further analysed the peculiarities of each of the military regimes. The study also examined the post-military era in the country and concluded with recommendations.\nMilitary dictatorship in Nigeria - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Nigerian military reign from 1966\u20131999 Federal Republic of Nigeria (1966; 1966\u20131979; 1983\u20131993; 1993\u20131999) Republic of Nigeria note (1966) 1966\u20131979 1983\u20131993 1993\u20131999 Flag Coat of arms Motto: \"Peace, Unity, Freedom\" [ 1 ] (1966\u20131978) \"Unity and Faith, Peace and Progress\" [ 1 ] (1978\u20131979; 1983\u20131993; 1993\u20131999) Anthem: Nigeria, We Hail Thee [ 1 ] (1966\u20131978) Arise, O Compatriots [ 1 ] (1978\u20131979; 1983\u20131993; 1993\u20131999) Capital Lagos (1966\u20131979; 1983\u20131991) Abuja (1991\u20131993; 1993\u20131999) Largest city Lagos Common languages English Hausa Igbo Yoruba and other regional languages Religion Christianity Islam Traditional beliefs Government Federal presidential republic under military dictatorship (January\u2013May 1966; 1966\u20131979; 1983\u20131993; 1993\u20131999) [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Unitary presidential republic under military dictatorship (24 May 1966 \u2013 31 August 1966) Head of State / President \u2022 1966 Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi b \u2022 1966\u20131975 Yakubu Gowon \u2022 1975\u20131976 Murtala Mohammed \u2022 1976\u20131979 Olusegun Obasanjo \u2022 1983\u20131985 Muhammadu Buhari \u2022 1985\u20131993 Ibrahim Babangida \u2022 1993\u20131998 Sani Abacha \u2022 1998\u20131999 Abdulsalami Abubakar c Chief of Staff / Vice President \u2022 1966 Babafemi Ogundipe (first) \u2022 1998\u20131999 Mike Akhigbe (last) Legislature None ( rule by decree ) Historical era Cold War \u2022 Established 15 January 1966 \u2022 Unification Decree [ 2 ] 24 May 1966 \u2022 1966 Nigerian counter-coup 28 July 1966 \u2022 Federal system restored [ 3 ] 31 August 1966 \u2022 Biafra secession d 30 May 1967 \u2022 1975 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat 29 July 1975 \u2022 1976 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt 13 February 1976 \u2022 Second Republic 1 October 1979 \u2022 1983 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat 31 December 1983 \u2022 1985 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat 27 August 1985 \u2022 1993 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat 17 November 1993 \u2022 Fourth Republic 29 May 1999 Area 1991 [ 4 ] 923,768 km 2 (356,669 sq mi) Population \u2022 1991 [ 4 ] 88,514,501 Currency Nigerian pound (1966\u20131973) Naira (\u20a6) (1973\u20131979; 1983\u20131993; 1993\u20131999) Time zone UTC +1 ( WAT ) ISO 3166 code NG Preceded by Succeeded by First Nigerian Republic Second Nigerian Republic Second Nigerian Republic Third Nigerian Republic Fourth Nigerian Republic Today part of Nigeria Cameroon e ^a Formal name of the country from 24 May to 31 August 1966.

Currently, 16 states plus the District of Columbia allow domestic absentee ballots that are postmarked by Election Day to be counted if they arrive after Election Day; 29 states extend that right to military and civilian voters living overseas, recognizing that international mail often delays ballot return. According to the U.S Constitution, states administer elections . Under the equal protection clause, however, the federal government can pass legislation to prevent inequalities in access to voting. This includes facilitating the right to vote of military service members and civilian U.S. citizens living overseas . The Supreme Court will decide whether federal law overrides state election administration in determining whether ballots that are postmarked by Election Day but arrive later can be counted. A 250-year history The history of absentee, or mail-in, ballots in U.S. elections stretches back 2\u00bd centuries. Soldiers first voted by mail during the American Revolution , when men from the town of Hollis, New Hampshire , wrote their town leaders asking to have votes counted in local elections. Pennsylvania passed the first law allowing soldiers to vote absentee in the War of 1812 , a right expanded in the Civil War when 19 Union and seven Confederate states allowed soldiers to vote absentee . Civil war soldiers who were away from their home state during the 1864 Ohio state election voted on tally sheets that were mailed in envelopes like this one. National Postal Museum, Smithsonian Institution Absentee voting for soldiers from all states was codified in federal law in 1942 . A 1944 amendment specified that ballots that were postmarked by Election Day and arrived within two weeks after Election Day could be counted. Some civilians residing overseas, including civilian government employees and spouses and dependents of military and civilian employees, gained absentee ballot voting rights with the 1955 Federal Voting Assistance Act . All overseas U.S. citizens were enfranchised with the 1975 Overseas Citizens Voting Act . The 1986 Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act consolidated military and civilian voting rules. Later laws addressed electronic communications. Over 1,000 military service members requested an absentee ballot in Mississippi\u2019s 2024 election, along with nearly 1,000 civilian overseas voters. Nationally, more than 900,000 people voted in 2024 under the uniformed and overseas citizens act. Many of these U.S. citizens would be affected by a ballot\nVote By Mail :: California Secretary of State Vote By Mail Choose Language English espa\u00f1ol County elections officials mail vote-by-mail ballots to all active registered voters.

By Linda Qiu July 14, 2014 Red foxes may roam all over Canada but you won\u2019t catch the conservative news network there, according to an Internet meme circulating since 2011. One version of the meme states that Fox New Channel is \"banned from operating in Canada\" because \"it\u2019s illegal in Canada to lie on airwaves.\" A reader sent the message to us and asked us to check it out. A mountie of lies We weren\u2019t able to verify the origins of the meme, though Bill O\u2019Reilly himself said in 2004 that Fox wasn\u2019t allowed in Canada -- not that he agreed with the lying part. The earliest iteration of the full claim we found comes from a Feb. 28, 2011, Huffington Post blog post by liberal radio host and activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \"The (false news) provision has kept Fox News and right wing talk radio out of Canada and helped make Canada a model for liberal democracy and freedom,\" wrote Kennedy. \"As a result of that law, Canadians enjoy high-quality news coverage including the kind of foreign affairs and investigative journalism that flourished in this country before Ronald Reagan abolished the \u2018Fairness Doctrine\u2019 in 1987.\" What Kennedy is likely referring to are provisions in Canadian broadcast policy, include the Radio Act and other policies, that prohibit \"any false or misleading news.\" These provisions against spreading misinformation used to be part of Canada\u2019s criminal code, according to Canadian media lawyer Paul Schabas. They were famously evoked to send Holocaust denier and neo-Nazi publisher Ernst Z\u00fcndel to trial in the 1980s. After the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that the code violated freedom of expression rights and thus was unconstitutional, the false news provisions were just regulations.

You could ask the person you\u2019re dialoguing with, does that wording sound like they want to reduce abortion, or in fact increase access to it? Why would Planned Parenthood promote, endorse, and financially support certain candidates, unless they knew that it would be financially beneficial for them to see those candidates win their elections? Randy writes, \u201cUnfortunately, any support of the abortion industry, which has no financial interest in keeping abortion rare\u2014in fact, quite the opposite\u2014only bolsters it.\u201d Notice that the Democratic party platform says nothing about keeping abortion rare; only \u201csafe\u201d and \u201clegal.\u201d (Compare this with the Republican platform .) To summarize: on the one hand, we have the good news that the abortion rate is continuing to decrease over time, and that the occupant of the White House isn\u2019t the only important factor when it comes to abortion rates. We know that the pro-life movement is making a big difference. On the other hand, we can\u2019t say that the abortion policies of the President don\u2019t matter; they do have power to set the course and direction of our country, impact state policies, and to either discourage or encourage the abortion industry. (And of course, there is also the presidential appointment of judges, and the effects of policies on pro-life ministries and organizations.) Hope this provides some helpful thoughts.

Jha said he thinks the rate \u201cshould come down over time because we\u2019re getting better at treating COVID.\u201d \u201cAnd so somebody who spends three weeks in the ICU, has severe lung damage and would have died two months ago might now survive,\u201d he said. \u201cBut let\u2019s be very clear, that if you spent three weeks in the ICU, have severe, diffuse lung damage and you survive, it\u2019s fabulous that you survived. That was not inconsequential.\u201d Even if the infection fatality rate is about 1%, that\u2019s \u201cstill a lot of people,\u201d Dr. Lee Riley , professor and chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us. \u201c I\u2019m more concerned about the actual numbers of people who are dying rather than the percent.\u201d As of July 6, that figure was 130,208 deaths in the United States , according to Johns Hopkins\u2019 figures. \u201cWhatever the proportion, we\u2019ve had over 130,000 deaths in the US so far,\u201d Morse, at Columbia University, said, \u201cmore than twice as many as died in the Vietnam War, and more than died in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan combined, but I don\u2019t think war could be called \u201899% harmless\u2019.\u201d McEnany said in the July 6 press briefing that Trump\u2019s claim was a reference to \u201cthe fact that mortality in this country is very low.\u201d And the case \u201cfatality rate in this country, vis-a-vis other European countries, is much lower than, let\u2019s say, France and Italy.\u201d The U.S., at 4.5%, does have a lower case fatality rate than France (14.6%) and Italy (14.4%), as well as other countries, but a higher rate than many countries, too. But McEnany\u2019s explanation doesn\u2019t support what Trump said, in claiming 99% of coronavirus cases are \u201ctotally harmless.\u201d In addition to those who die, many are hospitalized. In June, the CDC published data on the 1.3 million reported cases in the U.S. from Jan. 22 to May 30, finding: \u201cOverall, 184,673 (14%) patients were hospitalized, 29,837 (2%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and\nand Infectious Diseases, did not blunder, correctly stating what was known at that time about the ratio of fatalities to cases of both seasonal flu and COVID-19.\u201d Their full review can be read here .

It asserts that this is incorrect and that the \u201creal death rate is probably about five or ten times higher.\u201d They argue: \u201cAlthough it is difficult to know exactly how many people have caught Covid-19, or died from it, there have been a number of studies that have attempted to estimate the death rate. So far they tend to produce rates between 0.5% and 1%. \u201cLooking at English data, it is clear that the death rate must be much higher than the claimed 0.1%. Researchers who conducted a survey (the REACT-2 survey) by testing blood from a sample of the population, to see how many have Covid-19 antibodies, produced a detailed analysis that estimates an overall death rate of about 0.9%. \u201cThe RT article says there were around 40,00 Covid deaths in the UK \u2013 the actual figure is at least 44,400 in England alone, up to 30 June. If the death rate was 0.1% then some 44.4 million people \u2013 or 79% of the population in England \u2013 would have had to have caught Covid by early June. No reasonable estimate gets close to this figure.\u201d Their full analysis can be read here . Also on rt.com Weird science: Covid-19 does NOT cause heart damage, as blockbuster study had basic calculation errors When you strip everything else out, the reason for lockdown comes from a single figure: one percent. This was the prediction that Covid, if left unchecked, would kill around one percent of us. You may not think that percentage is enormous, but one percent of the population of the world is 70 million people \u2013 and that\u2019s a lot. It would mean 3.2 million Americans dead, and 670,000 Britons. But where did this one-percent figure come from? To find out we have to go back to what happened when the virus first began showing up at the beginning of the year.

Minneapolis live updates: ICE arrest powers expanded, memo says Jan 31, 5:23 PM 'Bring her home': Savannah Guthrie addresses her mother missing in possible abduction 3 hours ago Partial government shutdown expected to extend longer than anticipated Feb 1, 5:52 PM The number of COVID-19-associated deaths fell from 2023 across all age groups and racial/ethnic groups. Death rates from COVID-19 were highest among those aged 75 and older -- highlighting the impact the virus has had on the elderly population. However, the gap between death rates among racial/ethnic groups shrunk from 2022 to 2023. In 2022, the COVID death rate for white Americans was 58.6 per 100,000 compared to 71.0 per 100,000 for Black Americans. In 2023, the rate was 19.6 per 100,000 for white Americans and 17 per 100,000 for Black Americans. People visit the 'In America: Remember' public art installation near the Washington Monument on the National Mall on Monday, Sept. 20, 2021 in Washington, DC. The installation commemorates all the Americans who have died due to COVID-19, a concept by artist Suzanne Brennan Firstenberg, includes more than 650,000 small plastic flags, some with personal messages to those who have died, planted in 20 acres of the National Mall. Kent Nishimura/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images \"Because of the wide disparities that exist in COVID-related deaths, and we know that COVID deaths were not equal across the population, especially hit\u2026Black populations and other and African American people, it's not surprising that when you overall reduce COVID deaths, that will overall contribute to potentially sort of a closing of the gap,\" Brownstein said. He added that there is more work to be done to close the gap even further, including providing access to health care and insurance for traditionally underserved populations. Brownstein also said he hopes more efforts can be made to reduce deaths from traditional leading causes of death such as\nby CJ Ruhm \u00b7 2022 \u00b7 Cited by 52 \u2014 The estimates indicate that there were 649,411 (95% CI: 600,133 to 698,689) excess deaths in the U.S. from 3/20\u20132/21, a 23% (95% CI: 21%\u201325%) increase over ...\nfrom Covid. You know that, right? I mean our doctors are very smart people. So what they do is they say \u2018I\u2019m sorry but everybody dies of Covid,\u2019 \u201d Trump said, without citing any evidence, at a rally in Waterford Township, Michigan. There is no evidence for the President\u2019s claim and the statement represents a stunning attack on medical workers as the country faces its worst public health emergency in more than 100 years. As of Friday evening, more than 90,000 Americans have been diagnosed with Covid-19, a new daily high, and at least 929 deaths have been reported, according to a count from Johns Hopkins University. Two states, South Dakota and Wyoming, reported their highest daily death tolls on Thursday. Medical experts have long predicted that the fall and winter would bring spikes in coronavirus cases as temperatures dropped across the country and people began spending more time indoors, where the virus can more easily spread. The country is now experiencing that spike \u2013 the five days with the most reported Covid-19 cases have all come in the last week. There is no evidence that suggests hospitals or doctors are inflating their coronavirus numbers. According to new research published this month, there were 20% more deaths from March 1 through August 1 than normally would be expected. The American Medical Association, without naming the President, condemned claims that physicians inflate the number of Covid-19 patients they treat \u2013 calling such rumors \u201cmalicious, outrageous, and completely misguided.\u201d \u201cThe suggestion that doctors \u2013 in the midst of a public health crisis \u2013 are overcounting COVID-19 patients or lying to line their pockets is a malicious, outrageous, and completely misguided charge,\u201d Dr. Susan Bailey, president of the American Medical Association, said in a written statement. \u201cThroughout this pandemic, physicians, nurses, and frontline health care workers have risked their health, their safety and their lives to treat their patients and defeat a deadly virus,\u201d Bailey added. During his campaign stop, Trump claimed that other countries attribute deaths among coronavirus patients with underlying conditions to other factors, but in the United States, doctors choose Covid-19 because they get additional funds. \u201cIn Germany and other places, if you have a heart attack, or if you have cancer, you\u2019re terminally ill, you catch Covid, they say you die of cancer, you died of heart attack. With us, when in doubt choose Covid.

He also incorrectly suggested that after he contracted the disease, people then said immunity lasted only a few months, rather than being lifelong. Scientists don\u2019t know how long immunity might last, as we\u2019ve written , but experts never thought it would be lifelong, as no other human coronavirus infection provides such durable immunity. Current data suggest most people are protected against reinfection for at least several months, but how much longer that likely immunity extends is still unclear. It\u2019s impossible to know whether Trump has immunity. It\u2019s possible that the experimental antibody cocktail he received to treat his COVID-19 prevented him from mounting his own antibody response \u2014 and that he could become susceptible again more quickly than most other COVID-19 patients. In any case, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cautions against acting as though someone is immune. The agency recommends that even those who have had COVID-19 continue to take steps to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, including hand washing, mask wearing and physical distancing. #8: \u2018Saved\u2019 Millions\nSymbols are nice. Policy and practice is essential. Let\u2019s go\u2014we got work to do. #DNC2020.\u201d Opal Tometi, the third co-founder of Black Lives Matter, hasn\u2019t made any public statements we could find about Biden\u2019s candidacy. But she told The Guardian in September, \u201cCome tomorrow, we have 45 days to vote 45 out, and I believe it\u2019s one of those efforts that\u2019s all hands on deck.\u201d Trump is the 45th president . During the Democratic primary, Cullors endorsed both Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Garza\u2019s political action fund (not related to Black Lives Matter) endorsed Warren. As for the claims about Trump\u2019s endorsements, the president is backed by the National Rifle Association and he has gotten the support of the nation\u2019s major law enforcement organizations. But Biden has gotten endorsements from some law enforcement officials, too. The NRA announced its endorsement on July 20, but that wasn\u2019t a surprise. The NRA endorsed Trump in 2016, as it has done for every Republican presidential candidate since 2004. (It didn\u2019t publicly endorse George W. Bush in 2000 in order to help him with moderates in swing states, according to press reports at the time.) Trump has received the backing of major law enforcement organizations, including the Fraternal Order of Police , an advocacy group that reports having more than 355,000 members. Like the NRA, the FOP has a history of backing Republican candidates. He also received the support of the National Association of Police Organizations , a lobbying group that says it represents 241,000 officers . NAPO backed former President Barack Obama in 2012. The International Union of Police Associations , a union that represented about 23,000 members as of 2018, has endorsed Trump, too. But Biden has received the backing of the National Association of Government Employees, which includes the 15,000-member International Brotherhood of Police Officers. He\u2019s also gotten the endorsement of more than 175 current and former law enforcement officials. So, the claim that Biden was endorsed by \u201cBLM and Antifa\u201d is false, although some of the Black Lives Matter founders have offered support for him separately from the organization. And Trump has gotten the endorsement of the NRA and the major law enforcement organizations, but some law enforcement officials have endorsed Biden.

The presentation is coming weeks after billionaire oil mogul, Prince Arthur Eze allegedly presented 12 Lexus 570 SUVs to 12 traditional rulers who were suspended for joining him to Abuja to see President Muhammadu Buhari. Eze had also accused Obiano of ill treatment to traditional rulers in the state by refusing to give five per cent of the state\u2019s revenue to the traditional institution as had been agreed by the federal government. But Obiano while handing over the vehicle at Dr. Alex Ekwueme Square, Awka, the state capital, said it was to appreciate their efforts in entrenching development including security of lives and property at the grassroots. He also commended them for overseeing the successful execution of the N20 million community infrastructure (choose-your-project) at their respective communities, assuring that his administration would continue to provide for the traditional institution. Also speaking, the Commissioner for Local Government, Community and Chieftaincy Affairs, Mr. Greg Obi, said the traditional rulers were the bedrock and foundation for government achievement in all areas of the economy. Responding on behalf of the monarchs, the Chairman, Anambra State Traditional Rulers Council and Obi of Onitsha, HRH Alfred Achebe tasked colleagues on unity and loyalty to constituted authority, while pledging unalloyed support of the traditional rulers to the government.

Zarah Buhari and Kiki Osinbajo, were in the fore among Nigerian influencers who kicked against the abominable acts of the defunct SARS. The two young ladies had through their separate Instagram accounts thrown support for the campaign to end brutality against citizens traced to the unit. Nigerians have for long mounted #EndSARS campaign, providing verifiable evidence of brutality, extra-judicial killing, torture and all forms of inhuman treatment meted on fellow Nigerians by SARS operatives, who dressed more like armed bandits, than wear any official anti-crime paraphernalia. Although the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, had penultimate week announced the disbandment, he immediately reinstated the ban through a statement by the Force Public Relations Officer (FPRO), DCP Frank Mba, but succumbed to pressure and again personally issued a statement disbanding the notorious unit yesterday. Two of his predecessors had three times in the past disbanded SARS, but the notorious outfit swung back almost immediately, fueling speculation that the last has not yet been heard of the dreaded police unit. In mounting pressure for the outfit to be kicked out, Kiki Osinbajo had posted a picture on her Instagram handle showing a clenched fist with the caption, \u201cPOLICE BRUTALITY MUST END NOW. #endpolicebrutality #endsars\u201d.

The following year he was convicted of three federal felony charges that related to his purchase of a handgun while using narcotics in 2018. Also in 2024 he pleaded guilty to nine federal tax charges. However, in December 2024 Hunter Biden was pardoned by his father.

(more) Hunter Biden is the second of three children born to Joe Biden and his first wife, Neilia Hunter Biden. On December 18, 1972, Neilia Biden and infant daughter Naomi were killed in a car accident while on the way to pick out a Christmas tree . Hunter and his elder brother, Joseph Robinette (\u201c Beau \u201d) Biden III, who was known as Beau in the family, were critically injured. Among other injuries, Hunter suffered a broken skull and brain injuries. Joe Biden, who had been elected to the U.S. Senate six weeks earlier, took the oath of office in his sons\u2019 hospital room. In 1977 Joe Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs , who became Hunter and Beau\u2019s stepmother. Jill and Joe Biden have a daughter, Ashley Blazer Biden, who was born in 1981. Hunter Biden attended Archmere Academy, a Roman Catholic high school in Claymont, Delaware, following in the footsteps of his father and elder brother. He spent his first year of college at the University of Pennsylvania , then enrolled in Georgetown University in 1988, where he graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in history in 1992. After graduation, he moved on to Portland , Oregon , and he served in the Jesuit Volunteer Corps , where he met Kathleen Buhle. Three months into their relationship, Buhle became pregnant; the two were married in July 1993, and their daughter Naomi King Biden was born in December.

The law also capped the out-of-pocket price for insulin that\u2019s covered under Medicare Part B, which covers drugs administered in a health care provider\u2019s office. The caps went into effect last year. STAT, a news site that covers health care issues, reported that the idea for a $35 cap for seniors initially came from Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical company, which proposed it in 2019.

He wants the Trump tax cuts to expire. So everybody \u2026 [is] going to pay four to five times \u2013 nobody ever heard of this before.\u201d Trump regularly warns of massive tax hikes for \u201ceverybody,\u201d should Biden be reelected. That doesn\u2019t jibe with anything Biden has proposed. In his more than three years as president, Biden\u2019s major tax changes have included setting a minimum corporate tax rate of 15% and lowering taxes for some families by expanding the child tax credit and, for a time, making it fully refundable, meaning families could still receive a refund even if they no longer owe additional taxes. As we wrote in 2020, when Trump made a similar claim, Biden proposed during that campaign to raise an additional $4 trillion in taxes over the next decade, although the increases would have fallen mainly on very high-income earners and corporations. The plan would not have doubled or tripled people\u2019s taxes at any income level (on average), according to analyses of Biden\u2019s plan by the Penn Wharton Budget Model , the Tax Policy Center and the Tax Foundation . In March 2023, the TPC\u2019s Howard Gleckman wrote that Biden proposed a 2024 budget that would, on average, increase after-tax incomes for low-income households and \u201cleave them effectively unchanged for middle-income households.\u201d The Tax Policy Center noted, \u201cThe top 1 percent, with\nshouldn\u2019t have to go beg\u2019: A protest over insulin prices is seen as a fight\u2026 Recommended New rule would force PBMs to disclose drug rebates\u2026 New rule would force PBMs to disclose drug rebates and other fees Newsom files a civil rights complaint against CMS\u2019 Oz\u2026 Newsom files a civil rights complaint against CMS\u2019 Oz in latest feud with the Trump administration Trump\u2019s addiction initiative brings bold rhetoric but few details Trump\u2019s addiction initiative brings bold rhetoric but few details Recommended Stories Politics Bob Herman STAT Plus: Trump administration signals there\u2019s widespread desire to curb Medicare Advantage Biotech Jason Mast STAT Plus: FDA halts gene therapy trials after brain tumor found in patient Advertisement Politics Katie Palmer STAT Plus: Senators raise concerns about TrumpRx in letter to HHS watchdog The Readout Meghana Keshavan STAT Plus: Launch of Wegovy pill looks to be going strong so far The Readout Elaine Chen STAT Plus: New startup to develop a GLP-1 drug for addiction\nthe younger Biden sleeping and screenshots of unverified emails claiming that he had used his position on the board of an energy company to set up a meeting with his father, then the vice president.

The New York Post article did not include any of the child abuse rumors. But the child abuse conspiracy theories about Hunter Biden that emerged from the fringes of the internet began swirling before the New York Post article and can be traced to associates of former White House aide Steve Bannon.

Add NBC News to Google President Trump, Joe Biden deliver 'two very different closing messages' 02:55 Whitney Phillips, an assistant professor of communications and rhetoric at Syracuse University, said that pro-Trump trolls are \"playing the hits from 2016\" and hoping they stick with voters who didn't hear the first iteration of the rumor four years ago. She noted that pushing child abuse conspiracy theories echoes what Bannon has publicly advocated in an effort to alter how voters feel. \"This is gaslighting of the highest order,\" Phillips said. \"This has been the Steve Bannon playbook this entire time. He has celebrated the strategy of ' flooding the zone with s--- ' \u2014 when you confuse people, when you make them angry, when you just sort of throw too many things at them for them to process.\" The re-run of an identical conspiracy theory from 2016, this time with Hunter Biden as the new target, gathered momentum in part because of a new disinformation pipeline promoted by high-profile conservative figures \u2014 including the president.

The magazine has faced significant backlash, particularly from Muslim communities, for its portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad.\n\n2. **Key Points from Knowledge**:\n   - Charlie Hebdo has a history of publishing controversial cartoons that many Muslims find offensive, particularly those depicting the Prophet Muhammad.\n   - The magazine's actions have sparked debates about freedom of expression versus respect for religious beliefs.\n   - The phrase \"cardinal and unforgivable sin\" suggests a moral judgment about the magazine's actions, which reflects a perspective that views such depictions as deeply offensive.\n   - The statement implies a broader narrative of hostility from Western institutions towards Islam, which is a subjective interpretation and can vary based on individual perspectives.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Claim**: The statement claims that the actions of Charlie Hebdo reveal a \"hatred and hostility\" from Western political and cultural institutions towards Islam. This is a subjective interpretation and not an objective fact. While some may view the magazine's actions as indicative of a broader cultural hostility, others may argue that it is a matter of free speech and satire.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The statement presents a subjective viewpoint rather than an objective fact. While it is true that Charlie Hebdo's actions have been controversial and have led to significant backlash, the assertion that this reveals a systemic hatred and hostility from Western institutions is a matter of interpretation and opinion.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the factual accuracy of the statement is not supported by objective evidence and is more of a subjective claim.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 0, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.6}

Most of the increase of income relative to 2022 was from interest paid on one of the couple\u2019s bank accounts, according to the tax return.

Sensitive to the complaints Clinton faced as she tried to keep some of her speeches private, the Biden campaign made a point of saying that more than half his speaking engagements were open to the media. According to Biden\u2019s financial reports, his speaking fees were as high as $234,820 in one case. When Biden gave a lecture at Drew University in New Jersey in March 2018, he was paid $190,000. A couple of weeks later, he was paid $180,000 to speak at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. A Biden campaign official said the large speaking fees from universities came from special funds not linked to school tuition. Still, large fees from schools could be an issue at a time Biden and other candidates have made the rapid rise in the cost of attending college a major campaign issue. Biden may have avoided some of the landmines that hurt Clinton. While the details provided on the financial disclosures are vague for some of his events, there do not appear to be any checks collected from Wall Street investment banks or other big corporate interests. Overall, the documents showed the Bidens reported income of $396,456 in 2016, more than $11 million in 2017 and $4.6 million in 2018. The couple paid federal income tax at a rate of 23.5% in 2016, 33.9% in 2017 and 33.4% in 2018. Their charitable donations rose with their income: In 2016, the Bidens gave 1.5% of their income to charity; in 2017, they gave 9.2%; and in 2018, they donated 6%. Sizeable chunks of their donations went to nonprofits named for the Bidens.

The Job Support Scheme was introduced to support businesses and employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in areas with restrictions.\n\n2. **Universal Credit**: The statement mentions Universal Credit, which is a benefit for individuals who are on a low income or out of work. It can supplement income for those who are unable to work due to COVID-19 restrictions.\n\n3. **Wage Coverage**: The claim states that this combination will result in employees receiving 80% of their wages. Historically, during the pandemic, the government provided various support schemes, including the furlough scheme, which covered up to 80% of wages for employees unable to work due to COVID-19 restrictions. However, the specifics of the Job Support Scheme and its application in tier 3 areas may differ.\n\n4. **Tier 3 Areas**: The statement specifically refers to tier 3 areas, which were subject to stricter lockdown measures. The support available in these areas was designed to help employees who could not work due to these restrictions.\n\nNow, considering the above points, the statement's claim that employees in tier 3 areas will receive a combination of the Job Support Scheme and Universal Credit to cover 80% of their wages is not entirely accurate. The Job Support Scheme did not guarantee 80% of wages for all employees; it provided a different level of support depending on the circumstances, and Universal Credit would supplement income but not necessarily bring it to 80% of previous wages.\n\nTherefore, the statement is misleading regarding the specifics of the support available and the percentage of wages covered.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "COVID-19 Self-Isolation Payment Skip to main content Top of the Page COVID-19 self-isolation payment A new government city benefit scheme was launched on 1 September 2020 which will see eligible individuals receiving up to \u00a3182 if they are required to go into self-isolation due to COVID-19.\u00a0 Initially it will apply only in certain areas in England which are affected by local lockdowns.

But it\u2019s progressive ideas that might carry him to the presidency O n Tuesday , Joe Biden did something unprecedented for a Democratic candidate assured of nomination: he moved left. In a speech delivered from Wilmington in his home state of Delaware, Biden unveiled the most ambitious clean energy and environmental justice plans ever proposed by the nominee of a major American political party. The plans, which the Biden campaign described to reporters as \u201cthe legislation he goes up to [Capitol Hill] immediately to get done,\u201d outline $2tn in investments in clean energy, jobs and infrastructure that would be carried out over the four years of his first term. Forty percent of these investments would be directed to communities of color living on the toxic edge of the fossil fuel economy \u2013 communities that have also been among the most devastated by the coronavirus pandemic. Biden proposes to pair these investments with new performance standards, most notably a clean electricity standard that would transition the United States to a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035. Part of Biden\u2019s \u201c Build Back Better \u201d agenda, these plans are a Green New Deal in all but name. If you set aside the most attention-grabbing left-wing programs included in New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s 2019 Green New Deal resolution , like Medicare for All and a federal job guarantee, Biden\u2019s plans broadly align with an approach advocated by the left-wing of the Democratic party. Firstly, like the Green New Deal, Biden\u2019s plans reframe climate action as a jobs, infrastructure and clean energy stimulus .

President Donald Trump's first line of the night, about COVID-19 deaths, was false and set the tone as he and Democratic rival Joe Biden unleashed a torrent of claims in their last presidential debate . Trump misrepresented the reality of the pandemic in myriad and familiar ways, insisting against obvious reality that the pandemic is drawing to a close. He also boasted about \"clean\" facilities at the border for migrant children, ignoring the filthy conditions under which they were held in 2018. Biden, at times, was selective on the coronavirus and other matters, at one point stating that no one under Obamacare lost private health coverage. Millions did. A look at how some of the statements on the stage in Nashville, Tennessee, compared with the facts: CORONAVIRUS TRUMP: \"We're rounding the turn. We're rounding the corner. It's going away.\" THE FACTS: No, the coronavirus isn't going away. It's coming back. New cases are on the rise toward their summer peak. Deaths have also been increasing. According to data through Oct. 21 from Johns Hopkins University, the seven-day rolling average for daily new cases in the U.S. rose over the past two weeks from over 42,300 on Oct. 7 to nearly 60,000 on Oct. 21. In that time the seven-day rolling average for daily new deaths in the U.S. rose from 695 to 757. ___ TRUMP: \"All he does is talk about shutdowns. But forget about him. His Democrat governors Cuomo in New York, you look at what's going on in California, you look at Pennsylvania, North Carolina. Democrats \u2014 Democrats all.

As a nation, we now find ourselves at a different point in the pandemic \u2013 with more tools and resources than ever before to better protect ourselves and our communities. CDC has been working for many months to fold the agency\u2019s COVID-19 emergency response activities into its existing structure and programs, as part of an ongoing transition to sustainable public health practice. The agency has also been working with partners, including states and local territories, to prepare for the end of the PHE declaration and communicate updated reporting requirements and cadences. While reporting frequency and source data for some metrics will shift when the PHE declaration ends, CDC will continue to report valuable data to inform individual and\nin certain countries. In October 2021, the White House announced that, starting November 8, 2021, the U.S. government would move away from the country-by-country restrictions previously applied during the COVID-19 pandemic and adopt travel policies that rely primarily on vaccination to advance the safe resumption of travel.

The map's color coding reflects whether infections are likely increasing or decreasing: Dark purple: Infections are growing Purple: Infections are likely growing Gray: Infections are likely not changing Green: Infections are likely declining Dark green: Infections are declining The accuracy of R t can be temporarily affected by changes in how many people with infections go to emergency departments (i.e. if a new variant or strain emerges that causes more severe disease) and by changes\nantibiotic-related ED visits in kids Guinea worm disease nears worldwide elimination, with only 10 cases in 2025 New guidance aims to guide UTI treatment in age of virtual health care Quick takes: Avian flu in Dutch cows, US birds; supplement-linked Salmonella; new polio cases Sanofi scraps plan to develop next-generation mRNA seasonal flu vaccine Viral\u2014but not bacterial or fungal\u2014infections fell sharply in NICUs amid COVID pandemic, study concludes HHS remakes federal autism committee, includes anti-vaccine members CARB-X receives $60 million from Wellcome to support early-stage antibiotic R&D This week's top reads Contrary to CDC changes, AAP advises vaccinating kids against 18 diseases Recommended vaccines include those against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, hepatitis A and B, rotavirus, and meningococcal disease.

Actress Kangana Ranaut\u2019s tweets on Mumbai Police and comparing the city to Pakistan occupied Kashmir did not go down well with the president of the cinema wing of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, Ameya Khopkar. The actress\u2019 tweet continued to evoke criticism on the second day as well and social media users have slammed her for disrespecting the city. On Friday, Khopkar took to Twitter and warned those who have spoken against Mumbai Police, without taking any names. \u201cToday, the city is safe only because of Mumbai Police and women can travel alone even at midnight. We will not allow anyone to unjustly criticise and defame the Mumbai Police,\u201d he tweeted in Marathi. \u201cMumbai Police officials are the ones who stand on their feet with courage regardless of the issues they face. Anyone who has a problem with the police force are free to continue living to their respective states.

In recent months, ID2020 has been the subject of conspiracy theories. We\u2019ve previously written about a false claim that Gates has proposed tracking people with microchips. Some have evidently linked such baseless claims also to ID2020. As Snopes reports , those claims misrepresent ID2020\u2019s projects. The notion that a Gates project was \u201ccancelled\u201d may be a reference to an at-home testing initiative for the novel coronavirus, backed by Gates, that was taking place in the Seattle area. The Food and Drug Administration recently ordered the project to temporarily halt its effort until additional approvals were granted; but it hasn\u2019t been permanently canceled. That project \u2014 the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network \u2014 wrote on its website on May 14 that \u201c SCAN\u2019s test is authorized by the Washington State Department of Health.

Pursuant to that order, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was tasked with establishing an AI task force and developing a strategic plan, which they released at the beginning of January. President Biden\u2019s order, according to the Trump administration, \u201cestablished unnecessarily burdensome requirements for companies developing and deploying AI that would stifle private sector innovation and threaten American technological leadership.\u201d President Trump has named a new Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, and has called for the development of an AI action plan within 180 days. President Trump signed a new order titled \u201cRemoving Barriers to American AI Innovation,\u201d which claims the Biden-era order hindered innovation and placed \u201cunnecessary government control over the development of AI.\u201d It also states that \u201cAmerican development of AI systems must be free from ideological bias or engineered social agendas. President Trump has publicly announced support for the $500B \u201cStargate Initiative,\u201d which is meant to fuel AI adoption in healthcare, manufacturing, and defense through private funding. The leaders of the AI companies funding this initiative have highlighted AI\u2019s ability to transform health care, including using AI to rapidly develop new vaccines. While the new administration\u2019s support for innovation in AI is apparent, the direction for the regulation and oversight of AI in health care is murkier than ever before. 4. World Health Organization . President Trump issued an Order requiring the United States to leave the World Health Organization (WHO), which is consistent with his 2020 push for the United States\u2019 exit that former President Biden blocked shortly after he was inaugurated in 2021.

Regaining strength after chemotherapy Though Ginsburg looks like she\u2019s been kicking gym butt all her life in that CNN promo, she wasn\u2019t always in such killer shape. In fact, when she first consulted with Johnson in 1999, after finishing chemotherapy for colon cancer, she was far from feeling her best. \u201cShe was very [drained] after the chemotherapy, and she and her husband felt she had to start focusing on her strength,\u201d Johnson, who also serves as an expert on The Vitamin Shoppe Wellness Council and has been a member of the U.S army for over 30 years, tells NBC News BETTER. \u201cI was recommended to her by another judge I\u2019d been training after she reached out to him.

You better Gal Get out of here.\u201d The counter man prattled on, arguing only with himself now. \u201cWell, she was an athlete when she was young. They say that the key to a long life is physical fitness when you\u2019re young. So, I can see it.\u201d While this may be true, I\u2019m 36 years-old and have avoided breaking a non-panic attack sweat for my whole life so I probably only have a couple years left.

There was absolutely nothing to be mad at in this unassuming, friendly workout book. The warm-ups take about 15 pages, or 10 minutes. They consist of simple stretches and a walk on a treadmill. Next comes strength exercises. This takes up the bulk of the workout. Using free weights, resistance bands, medicine balls, Swiss balls and sometimes household objects like chairs and ottomans, Johnson focuses on different muscle groups with exercises usually in sets of three. Finally, you cool down with another round of stretches. While it's all recommended, none of it is required and Johnson offers a number of slightly less intense iterations. \"If you reach a point where you feel like you just caught a ride on the struggle bus... I hereby order you to recuse yourself from the rest of the workout,\" Bryant writes. The RBG Workout is filled with accessible instructions and short pep talks like this. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with setting specific goals,\u201d Bryant writes in one pep talk, \u201cbut the most important outcome of an exercise can\u2019t be quantified.

The NPR correspondent Nina Totenberg , a reporter covering Supreme Court who published the original report about Justice Ginsburg's last wish, subsequently confirmed that the statement had come from Ginsburg herself. Totenberg stated that there were other witnesses in the room, apart from her granddaughter, including her doctor. [ 49 ] Trump's allegation gave birth to a conspiracy theory which spread quickly through social media and was taken up by some conservative public figures. Fox News host Tucker Carlson declared that it would have been \"pathetic\" for Justice Ginsburg to make such a dying declaration and that he did not believe she had said it. [ 50 ] Subsequently, Senator Ted Cruz , Republican from Texas , blocked the U.S. Senate resolution honoring Ginsburg because it contained language referring to her dying wish. [ 51 ] International [ edit ] Ursula von der Leyen , President of the European Commission , described Ginsburg as a \"pioneer for women's right, law and justice\".

{"claim": "Joe Biden said 'If Your 8-Year-Old Child Says They Want To Be Transgender, They Have A Right To Transition'.", "label": "Not Enough Evidence", "result": {"response": "To assess the factual accuracy of the statement regarding Joe Biden's alleged quote about children transitioning, we need to analyze the context and content of the claim.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The statement claims that Joe Biden said that if an 8-year-old child expresses a desire to be transgender, they have a right to transition. This is a significant assertion that touches on sensitive topics regarding children's rights, gender identity, and medical ethics.\n\n2. **Context of Biden's Statements**: Joe Biden has made various statements regarding LGBTQ+ rights and the rights of transgender individuals, particularly in the context of supporting their rights and protections. However, the specific quote attributed to him in the statement is not widely documented or verified in credible sources.\n\n3. **Fact-Checking Sources**: A thorough search through reputable news outlets, fact-checking organizations, and official transcripts of Biden's speeches does not yield any direct evidence of him making this exact statement. While Biden has expressed support for transgender rights, the phrasing in the statement appears to be a misrepresentation or simplification of his views.\n\n4. **Misinformation and Misinterpretation**: The claim could stem from a misinterpretation of Biden's broader advocacy for transgender rights, which includes support for policies that protect transgender youth. However, the specific assertion that he stated children have a right to transition at such a young age lacks substantiation.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of credible evidence supporting the exact quote attributed to Biden, and considering the context of his advocacy for LGBTQ+ rights, the statement appears to be misleading or false.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "Fact check: Doctored image spreads false claim on age of consent FACT CHECK Joe Biden Add Topic Fact check: Doctored image of a CNN article falsely reports on age of consent change Devon Link USA TODAY Feb. 5, 2021 Updated Feb. 14, 2021, 3:44 p.m. ET The claim: Biden lowered the age of consent Throughout the 2020 campaign, QAnon supporters pushed baseless accusations of pedophilia among elites.
