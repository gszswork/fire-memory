Full Episode Monday, Feb 2\nthat Trump's senior adviser Hope Hicks had tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday. Shortly after, it was announced that the president and first lady had been tested and were awaiting results. Trump revealed in a tweet just before 1 a.m. that they both had tested positive. \"Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19,\" Trump tweeted. \"We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!\" In a memo shortly after Trump's tweet, Dr. Conley wrote, \"The President and First Lady are both well at this time, and they plan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence.\" Trump's Friday schedule, which was set to include a trip to a campaign rally in Florida, was cleared except for one phone call to discuss \"COVID-19 support to vulnerable seniors.\" How could COVID-19 potentially affect Trump? Trump is 74 years old, which puts him at higher risk of experiencing more severe COVID-19 symptoms. People between the ages of 65 and 74 are nearly five times more likely to be hospitalized for COVID-19 related complications than those between ages 18 and 29, according to June data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People 75 to 84 years old are about 7 times more likely to be hospitalized than the 18 to 29 age group. \"There's no evidence that [Trump] is seeing or experiencing any conflicts or any particular serious symptoms as of right now,\" Alcindor said to Brangham. \"But I want to reiterate that we're talking about a senior citizen, and someone who falls in the group of people that Dr. [Anthony] Fauci and so many other health officials have said have to be extra vigilant when it comes to this virus.\" Gary Simon, a medical doctor and director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at George Washington University, told the PBS NewsHour that it's unclear at this point how the virus will affect Trump's heath. \"It's very hard to predict simply based on the epidemiology, how he's going to do. Certainly he's going to do worse than somebody with the same symptoms who's 25 years old,\" Simon said. \"But the markers that predict disease are mostly laboratory markers, and we don't know any of those.\" Throughout his first term the White House has been vague regarding the details of Trump's health.

Watch the conversation in the video player above. The president and his wife are both displaying symptoms, though White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said they are mild. In a memo Friday afternoon, White House physician Sean Conley said Trump received a single 8-gram dose of Regeneron's polyclonal antibody cocktail as treatment, adding that the president \"remains fatigued but in good spirits.\" The White House released a statement on Friday-- less than 24 hours after his positive test was announced-- that the president was being moved to Walter Reed hospital. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said that Trump \"remains in good spirits\" but will be moved to Walter Reed and working from there for the coming days \"out of an abundance of caution, and at the recommendation of his physician and medical experts.\" The news of Trump's diagnosis sparked a flurry of questions over the future of Trump's campaign, the dozens of people he's had contact with in recent days, as well as how the illness will affect his presidential duties. PBS NewsHour's William Brangham and Yamiche Alcindor answered questions from viewers about Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis and what this means for the 2020 election. How did the news of Trump's diagnosis unfold? Bloomberg News first reported on Thursday night that Trump's senior adviser Hope Hicks had tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday. Shortly after, it was announced that the president and first lady had been tested and were awaiting results. Trump revealed in a tweet just before 1 a.m. that they both had tested positive. \"Tonight, @FLOTUS and I\nFact check: False claim that Trump's COVID-19 test result is a 'con' FACT CHECK fact-checking Add Topic Fact check: Claim that Trump's positive COVID-19 test result is a 'con' has no basis in fact Chelsey Cox USA TODAY Oct. 3, 2020 Updated Oct. 4, 2020, 12:12 p.m. ET The claim: President Donald Trump's positive COVID-19 test result might be a 'con' job Social media reactions to the news that President Donald Trump tested positive for the coronavirus ranged from well-wishes to skepticism. On Oct. 2, author and former attorney Richard Greene posted his speculations on Facebook, suggesting Trump's positive test result could be a \"con.\" Greene also wrote a 2016 Huffington Post story : \"Is Donald Trump Mentally Ill? 3 Professors Of Psychiatry Ask President Obama To Conduct \u2018A Full Medical And Neuropsychiatric Evaluation.\u2019\" His post soon went viral. There are three reasons, according to Greene, not to trust the White House's announcement that Trump tested positive: Trump was on his way to losing his reelection bid after his performance during the first presidential debate on Sept. 29. Testing positive for COVID-19 redirected attention away from the topic of white supremacists. By \"sailing through\" a fake illness, Trump could prove his mettle to supporters and emulate Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Greene doesn't trust \"anything that comes out of (Trump's) mouth, or his 'Twitter thumbs.'\" Greene did not mention first lady Melania Trump's positive test result in his post. \"My FB post on it was instantaneous and has received more, and quicker, response ... and more positive response ... than anything I believe I have ever posted,\" Greene told USA TODAY in an email. Greene attributed his skepticism to \"severe cynicism\" after untruths told by Trump during his presidency, as well as a \"Coronavirus October Surprise.\" Trump has made more than 20,000 false or misleading claims during his term, according to a July report by The Washington Post's Fact Checker. \"The term 'October Surprise' was coined by a 1980s political operative but has ever since been appropriated by the media to describe unexpected political disasters in the twilight hours of the campaign,\" the Smithsonian Magazine explained , adding \"they\u2019ve become a staple of modern politics.\" In Greene's view, an \"October surprise\" is one of \"12 Ways Donald Trump Can Win,\" a list compiled by Greene in an Aug. 23 Medium blog post .

This implies that simply receiving multiple ballot applications does not equate to the ability to vote multiple times.\n\n2. **Bar Codes and Registered Voters**: The mention of bar codes matching to registered voters suggests a system in place to prevent fraudulent voting. This means that if a person attempts to vote multiple times, the system would likely flag this due to the unique identification of registered voters.\n\n3. **Voting Regulations**: The knowledge does not provide specific regulations regarding voting multiple times, but it implies that there are checks in place to prevent such occurrences.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that a man receiving four ballot applications cannot legally vote four times in the election.

However, without specific details or evidence, we cannot verify this part of the statement.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Second Part**: \n   - The claim that the NFL honored an organization that yelled \"hope they die\" is quite serious and would require substantial evidence. The NFL is a major organization that typically maintains a public image of compassion and community support. If such an event occurred, it would likely be widely reported and would raise significant public outcry.\n\n4. **Cross-Referencing with Available Knowledge**: \n   - There is no known instance or credible report of the NFL honoring any organization associated with such a hateful and violent statement. This part of the statement raises immediate red flags regarding its truthfulness.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: \n   - The first part of the statement could be plausible but lacks specific verification. The second part, however, seems highly unlikely given the NFL's public stance and reputation.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement is misleading and contains a factual inaccuracy regarding the NFL's actions.\n\nFinal answer in the required format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 0, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.0}

Vermont Automatic mail-in voting (general elections only) Every voter\nrequire that eligible voters initiate the process for receiving, and casting, mail-in ballots. These have traditionally been described as absentee voting systems. Background Every state provides for some method whereby voters can cast ballots without visiting a physical polling place. The terms absentee voting , voting by mail , or voting from home are sometimes used to describe these methods, which can be divided into two categories: automatic mail-in ballot systems and request-required mail-in ballot systems . Automatic mail-in ballot systems See also: All-mail voting Automatic mail-in ballot systems mandate that all eligible voters receive a ballot by default. These are sometimes referred to as all-mail voting systems. Access to mail-in voting is not restricted to voters meeting certain eligibility criteria and officials automatically transmit mail-in ballots to all eligible voters. Voters may return these ballots by mail or by using designated deposit sites. Limited in-person voting is generally available, although the number of polling sites and terms of accessibility vary from state to state. One state, Nevada, allows voters to opt out of all-mail voting. [3] Request-required mail-in ballot systems Request-required mail-in ballot systems require that eligible voters initiate the process for receiving and casting mail-in ballots. These have traditionally been described as absentee voting systems. There are two types of request-required mail-in ballot systems. No excuse required : Any voter may request a mail-in ballot. Generally, a voter must first submit an application in order to receive a ballot. The voter may then return the completed ballot by mail or by using a designated deposit site. In-person voting is dominant. Automatic mail-in ballot applications : In one state, Massachusetts, officials automatically transmit mail-in ballot applications to all eligible voters. A voter must complete and submit the application to receive a ballot. The voter then returns the completed ballot by mail or by using designated deposit sites. Excuse required : A voter must meet eligibility criteria in order to qualify for a mail-in ballot, such as having an illness or disability or being absent from their polling place on Election Day. Generally, a voter must first submit an application in order to receive a ballot. The voter may then return the completed ballot by mail or by using a designated deposit site.

The team noted that the probability of contracting a COVID-19 disease was 7% for mask wearers and 52% for non-mask wearers. The relative risk of getting infected by SARS-CoV-2 was 0.13 for mask wearers.

Study reveals pandemic life made brains age faster, even without catching COVID-19 In the healthcare setting, 9% of the mask wearers and 33% of the non-mask wearers tested COVID-19 positive. Furthermore, the relative risk of contracting COVID-19 was 0.20 for individuals wearing facemasks within the healthcare setting. Additionally, in community settings, the team noted that 6% of mask wearers and 83% of non-maks wearers tested SARS-CoV-2 positive. The relative risk of contracting COVID-19 in the community setting was 0.08 for mask wearers. The results showed an association between using a facemask and testing positive for COVID-19 since over 92% of the subjects who wore a mask did not test COVID-19 positive. The correlation between COVID-19-positivity and wearing a facemask varied considerably between the healthcare and community settings. Overall, 50% of subjects who did not wear a mask did not contract COVID-19. Notably, 83% and 33% of the subjects who did not wear a facemask in the community and healthcare settings contracted COVID-19, respectively. Compared to healthcare settings, the correlation between contracting COVID-19 and wearing a facemask was greater in the community setting. Overall, the study findings indicated that mask wearers were less likely to contract COVID-19 in healthcare and community settings. It will be necessary to conduct further research as more information becomes available. The researchers believe that future studies are necessary to ascertain the impact of regulations related to facemask usage and other interventions on COVID-19 transmission. *Important notice: medRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.

But once November 3 happened and we saw everything that happened since, we decided at the AP that we wanted to go to the source. We wanted to look for the voter fraud, and we wanted to identify what voter fraud had occurred, what potential voter fraud had occurred in the November 3 election. And so we embarked on this reporting effort that involved reporters in six states, the six states that were disputed by President Trump and his allies. And we went to the local election officials. And we asked them to identify for us any potential instances of voter fraud that they had flagged during their post-election certification and canvassing work. Judy Woodruff: And what did you find? Christina Cassidy: Well, in the end, we found it was just shy of 475 potential cases of voter fraud in those six states, which would not have made a difference in the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. Judy Woodruff: And this was out of millions of votes cast, if you add up all the votes in those states. Christina, tell us -- just give us a couple of examples of the fraud that you did find, those individual cases. Christina Cassidy: Sure. I mean, they ran the gamut. You had individuals like a gentleman from Wisconsin who was a felon, and he did not understand or did not know, he said, that he -- he thought he was eligible to vote. And so he voted. And it turns out Wisconsin is not one of those states that have loosened laws for felon voting. So, there was that instance. We had a woman in Maricopa County who has been charged. Authorities say that she submitted a ballot on behalf of her mother, who had died about a month before the election. And there were other instances of people who had submitted mail ballots. Either they had mailed them or dropped them off and those ballots showed up after they had voted in person, whether in early voting or on Election Day. Judy Woodruff: And we know that former President Trump, the people who support him, continue to push this notion of massive voter fraud, despite all evidence to the contrary.

Credit: Reuters/Cheney Orr Due to the speed and manner in which election results have historically been reported, many Americans are unfamiliar with the process election administrators undertake to reach a final vote tally. It is important for voters to understand the way these procedures regularly unfold to reduce uncertainty and increase voters\u2019 confidence in the process. More complete knowledge can allow voters to feel certain and confident in events as they occur, resist disinformation and enable them to recognize when the post-election process has truly gone awry. Election administration in the United States is highly localized. Different states and election jurisdictions (counties, cities or towns) conduct elections in different ways, but typically the local officials responsible for administering elections in their communities conduct most of the post-election procedures. Although specifics vary, election officials in every locality follow a defined set of steps designed to reach a complete and accurate vote count. These multi-step processes build in numerous checks and safeguards to ensure electoral integrity. What follows is an overview of how we get from voters casting ballots \u2013 early or on Election Day, in person or by mail \u2013 to a final determination of the winners of the contests on those ballots. 1. After Votes Are Cast In modern elections, votes are cast through numerous methods. Voters may vote in person (either before or on Election Day), by hand-marking a paper ballot or using an electronic voting machine, or they may submit a ballot by mail, deposit a ballot into a ballot drop-box, or turn in their ballot at a precinct or election office. This section describes how votes are collected immediately after being cast. a. In-Person Voting The majority of in-person voters in the 2020 election cast their vote by marking a paper ballot by hand or with an electronic marking device. Most often, the voter then runs the ballot through a scanner at the polling place to record their vote, but some jurisdictions collect the ballots to be scanned\nreinstate a checkbox that was dropped from Florida absentee ballots in 2021. The checkbox allowed the voter to request an absentee ballot for the next election. Mail-in ballot security Following concerns about the security of mail-in ballots in the 2000 election in Florida, the 2002 Help America Vote Act required that all states have a minimum security requirement. The multiple levels of scrutiny include signature comparison, ballot tracking and penalties for malfeasance from the moment of registration to ballot request, to ballot receipt. With these layers of security there were only an estimated four fraudulent votes cast for every 10 million mail-in ballots in the 2016, 2018, 2020 and 2022 U.S. general elections. Mail-in voting elsewhere The United States is one of 32 countries worldwide that allow mail-in voting for at least some of its citizens. These include the United Kingdom since 1945 and Germany since 1957 . In Germany\u2019s federal elections in 2025, 37% of all voters, or 18.5 million citizens , cast a ballot by mail. German citizens who are eligible to vote automatically receive ballots . In the United Kingdom\u2019s 2024 election, just under 5%, or nearly 1.3 million citizens , applied for mail-in ballots. The bottom line The Supreme Court case could reshape the voting landscape in the United States, potentially affecting 47 million people, including some 5 million military and civilian voters living abroad . Watson v. Republican National Committee could also affect laws in 29 states. The outcome of the case has the potential to make voting more difficult for millions of civilian and military voters at home and abroad.

However, five of those states (Colorado, Oregon, Utah, Hawaii and Washington) have been holding their elections primarily by mail since before the pandemic, so voters who register in these states do so knowing they\u2019ll likely submit their ballot by mail. The four remaining states (California, Vermont, Nevada, and New Jersey) plus Washington DC switched this year \u2014 so, voters there who were already registered didn\u2019t actively request a mail-in ballot for this election.

The five places that changed their policies for this election to send ballots to all voters \u2013 DC , California , Vermont, Nevada and New Jersey \u2013 have at least 29 million registered voters by the latest available count. Based on this data, the number of truly unsolicited ballots sent out is at most, around half of what the President claims, and likely even less. It\u2019s also worth noting that even in the unsolicited instances, states have safeguards in place to prevent the kind of fraud Trump implies will result from the projected increase in voting by mail this election.

What\u2019s new this year: \u2022 A dedicated Software category\nreceived an assignment the year earlier, when he tested positive for cocaine . In 2015 Beau Biden died of brain cancer , and his death sent Hunter Biden\u2019s life into a downward spiral. Hunter and Kathleen Biden\u2019s marriage had been failing, and in October 2015 they formally separated. They were divorced in 2017. Also in 2017, news reports surfaced that Hunter Biden was in a romantic relationship with Hallie Olivere Biden, Beau Biden\u2019s widow. Their relationship would end two years later. During this time Beau went through multiple periods of alcohol and drug binges followed by rehab efforts. In 2018 Hunter Biden fathered a daughter, Navy Joan Roberts, with Lunden Alexis Roberts of Arkansas. In his 2021 memoir, Beautiful Things , Hunter Biden wrote that he had \u201cno recollection\u201d of his encounter with Roberts. In May 2019 Biden married Melissa Cohen, a South African filmmaker. The couple had a baby boy in 2020. Hunter Biden took up painting as a form of therapy while recovering from his addictions. He credits Cohen for his sobriety. Legal troubles and pardon In 2020 Hunter Biden disclosed that the Justice Department has been investigating him since late 2018. The investigation was led by David C. Weiss, the U.S. attorney in Delaware, and involved potential criminal violations of tax and money-laundering laws. In June 2023 Hunter Biden agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor counts of failing to pay his 2016 and 2017 taxes on time. He also accepted conditions that would avoid his being prosecuted on a felony charge that he lied when he said he was sober when buying a handgun in 2018. But the plea deal collapsed when the judge in the case refused to be what she called \u201ca rubber stamp\u201d on the agreement that some said reflected preferential treatment of the first son. In August 2023 U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland announced that Weiss had been named the special counsel in charge of the investigation, and prosecutors filed court documents saying that they expected the Biden case to go to trial. In June 2024 Biden went on trial for the gun-related charges, and he was found guilty on all three counts later that month.

Trump, who has spent much of the year downplaying the threat of a virus that has killed more than 205,000 Americans, said he and Mrs. Trump were quarantining.

While some details of his condition are known \u2014 including experimental treatments usually reserved for severe cases, administered during a stay at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center -- it's unclear how the president contracted the virus and when he first started to experience symptoms or become contagious. Reports also suggest that efforts to discover who else in the president's orbit may be infected have been limited so far. It can take up to 14 days to show symptoms after being infected, but most tend to experience them between days three and five. Those with the virus can pass it to others between 48 to 72 hours before symptoms develop, unless they are asymptomatic. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows confirmed that Trump was experiencing \"mild symptoms\" on Friday afternoon, which suggests that those he came into contact with between Tuesday and Wednesday \u2014 including Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who shared a debate stage with the president Tuesday night but has tested negative in days since \u2014 could be at risk of infection. In news conferences over the weekend and on Monday, White House physician Dr. Sean Conley clarified some aspects of the president's health, but failed to answer a series of key questions : On what day did the president receive his last negative test before testing positive?

[ 4 ] Of the 37 that were unsuccessful, 11 nominees were rejected in Senate roll-call votes , 12 were withdrawn by the president, and 14 lapsed at the end of a session of Congress. Six of these unsuccessful nominees were subsequently nominated and confirmed to other seats on the Court. [ 5 ] Additionally, although confirmed, seven nominees either declined office or (in one instance) died before assuming office. [ 3 ] An important role in this process is played by the Senate Judiciary Committee , which conducts a comprehensive evaluation of a nominee's background and qualifications before the Senate considers the nomination. Once confirmed to a seat on the Court, justices have life tenure , and so they serve until they die in office, resign or retire, or are impeached and removed from office. Even so, as it requires a separate presidential appointment, an incumbent associate justice who is nominated to be chief justice must undergo the confirmation process again.

Specifically, the table lists the following for each Supreme Court nomination: name of each nominee; name of the president who made the nomination, and their political party affiliation; name of the justice whose departure created the vacancy (the column sorts so as to show the person-to-person succession of judges since 1789); majority party in the Senate at the time of the nomination; date on which the president formally made the nomination, by signing a nomination message; outcome, the type and date of final action by the Senate, or of a nomination's withdrawal by the president; number of days that elapsed from the date a nomination was formally submitted until the date of final Senate action or the nomination's withdrawal. The following final results of the nomination process are tracked: confirmed \u2013 nominations confirmed by the Senate (including those of persons who subsequently declined to serve, or who died before taking office); withdrawn \u2013 nominations withdrawn by the president prior to a confirmation vote; rejected \u2013 nominations rejected by the Senate; lapsed \u2013 nominations that lapsed at the end of a session of Congress without a Senate vote cast on whether to confirm (including nominations that were postponed or tabled by the Senate that were not given further consideration). Additionally, where the final Senate action on a nomination was a roll-call vote (as opposed to a voice vote or unanimous consent ), the totals for and against are noted. In listing all persons ever nominated to the Supreme Court, the table includes the names of those who were not confirmed as well as those who were confirmed but did not assume office.

But it\u2019s not clear that either woman was ever actually seriously in the running, as the president offered Barrett the job on Sept. 21 and nominated her on Sept. 26, in a ceremony at the White House that was notable for the dearth of masks and social distancing. At least 11 people who attended the ceremony later tested positive for COVID-19, including the president, two senators, and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. By the time Barrett\u2019s confirmation hearings began on Oct. 12, Democrats had few options to stop the nomination. Instead, they frequently argued that, if confirmed, Barrett would provide a key vote to strike down the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate and, with it, the rest of the law when the Supreme Court hears oral argument on Nov. 10 in a challenge to the mandate. Republican senators emphasized Barrett\u2019s qualifications for the job and her commitment to following the original meaning of the Constitution. Some senators, like Josh Hawley of Missouri, also condemned what they portrayed as attacks on Barrett\u2019s religion. When the Senate Judiciary Committee met on Oct. 22 to consider whether to send Barrett\u2019s nomination to the full Senate, Democratic senators were not there. Knowing they did not have the votes to stop the nomination from moving forward, several of them left photos of their constituents to fill their chairs \u2013 a move intended to symbolize the people who would be hurt if the ACA were struck down. Without any Democratic opposition, Barrett\u2019s nomination was voted out of committee unanimously. Going into Monday\u2019s final vote, there was little suspense about how the vote might turn out. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) had opposed moving forward with the confirmation process this close to the election, but she announced on Saturday that she would support Barrett\u2019s confirmation. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who had voted two years ago to confirm Kavanaugh, announced that she would vote against Barrett. No Democrats crossed party lines to vote for Barrett. In a ceremony at the White House shortly after the vote, Justice Clarence Thomas administered the constitutional oath, one of the two oaths that Barrett must take.

LGBTQ people and people living with HIV are more than twice as likely to be uninsured as the general population. Also, the judicial repeal of the ACA would unwind the progress made in significantly decreasing uninsured and underinsured rates for people living with HIV following the passage of the ACA. It is beyond question that Judge Barrett\u2019s supporters, including President Trump, know they can count on her to remain consistent in her academically fringe view that the ACA is unconstitutional. Given her public positions and the partisan nature of the debates about the law\u2019s fate, any claims to believe she would have an open mind if elevated cannot be credited. In 2017, then-Professor Barrett wrote that Justice Roberts \u201cpushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute\u201d in NFIB v. Sebelius (SCOTUS case upholding the individual mandate a tax valid under the Taxing power). Access to health care is an issue of profound importance to LGBTQ people and people living with HIV.

In addition, over 130 million people in the U.S. (including millions of Coronavirus survivors) suffer from preexisting conditions.

Following a pattern set by many Trump administration nominees, Judge Barrett then failed to disclose this information on her Senate Judiciary Committee questionnaire. Notably, Professor Barrett also has expressed her hostility towards contraceptive insurance by joining a letter in 2012, referring to the ACA\u2019s birth control insurance coverage as \u201c Unacceptable .\u201d Her position reflects not only her personal view that human life should be protected from the moment an egg is fertilized, a view far outside the mainstream, but also that our legal system should support that view despite the equally sincere religious and moral beliefs of those who disagree and whose lives would be directly affected. If views about reproductive health care were to become the law of the land, many thousands of couples \u2013 LGBTQ and not \u2013 who have depended on infertility medicine to become parents would not be able to start families. Racial Equity We are also\nBarrett confirmed as 115th justice - SCOTUSblog Skip to content Barrett confirmed as 115th justice By Amy Howe on Oct 27, 2020 The Senate on Monday night confirmed Judge Amy Coney Barrett as the 115th justice of the U.S. Supreme Court and the fifth woman to serve on the court. The 48-year-old Barrett fills the seat previously held by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died on Sept. 18 of complications from pancreatic cancer. The 52-48 vote capped a meteoric rise for Barrett, who spent almost all of her career as a law professor who was well regarded but little known outside academic circles. And for conservatives, the vote represented the culmination of a decades-long effort to move the ideological balance on the court solidly to the right. In contrast to Ginsburg, who spent nearly three decades as one of the court\u2019s most reliably liberal votes, Barrett has said that her judicial philosophy is similar to that of the late conservative hero Justice Antonin Scalia, for whom Barrett served as a law clerk. Democrats decried the decision to confirm Barrett less than two weeks before the upcoming presidential election, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) warned that the \u201cAmerican people will suffer the consequences of Judge Barrett\u2019s far-right, out-of-the-mainstream views for generations.\u201d Barrett catapulted onto the national scene in 2017, during the confirmation hearings for her seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit. Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee suggested that Barrett, who is a devout Catholic, might allow her faith to influence her judging \u2013 an allegation that Barrett staunchly denied. And perhaps most notably, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California told Barrett that, based on Barrett\u2019s speeches, \u201cthe conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within you.\u201d Feinstein\u2019s rhetoric did not keep Barrett from being confirmed to the court of appeals, by a vote of 55 to 43, on Oct. 31, 2017. In fact, it may have had the opposite effect: Conservative Catholics adopted the phrase as a rallying cry, putting it on coffee mugs and t-shirts, and Barrett\u2019s name was one of five names added in November 2017 to President Donald Trump\u2019s list of potential nominees to the Supreme Court. When Justice Anthony Kennedy retired from the Supreme Court in June 2018, Barrett was allegedly among the finalists to fill the vacancy. The job would go to Justice Brett Kavanaugh, but Trump\nland, saying that individual states should have been able to \u201cresolve this question through legislation\u201d and claimed the Court wrongfully \u201cbypassed that democratic process.\u201d It is clear that if confirmed, Justice Barrett would be in good company. In 2015, Coney Barrett signed onto a letter that said that she supports \u201cmarriage and family founded on the indissoluble commitment of a man and a woman.\u201d Transgender Rights In a lecture discussing issues that could soon come before the Supreme Court, then-Professor Barrett expressed the legally unsound and troubling view that transgender people are not protected by Title IX\u2019s federal prohibitions against sex discrimination in the context of education programs. Judge Barrett\u2019s approach has been soundly rejected by jurists spanning the political spectrum, perhaps most authoritatively twenty years ago by her mentor, Justice Scalia, for a unanimous Supreme Court, and most recently reaffirmed by Justice Gorsuch for a six-member majority in Bostock v. Clayton County , which extended federal protections against sex discrimination to LGBTQ employees. Equally, if not more disturbing, is how Judge Barrett has characterized transgender people. For example, she has opined that \u201c[p]eople will feel passionately on either side about whether physiological males who identify as females should be permitted in bathrooms especially where there are young girls present .\u201d (emphasis added). This misgendering of transgender people, particularly of transgender youth, callously disregards the legitimacy of their identity. Furthermore, this rhetoric invokes defamatory falsehoods suggesting not only that transgender girls are not truly girls, but that they somehow pose a threat to cisgender girls. Judge Barrett\u2019s ardent but misguided views about transgender people deserve particular scrutiny due to the number of issues likely to come before the Supreme Court soon, including Title IX\u2019s protections for transgender students, the Trump administration\u2019s ban on military service by transgender people, and numerous rule changes adversely affecting the ability of transgender people to work, stay in school, receive medically necessary care, and fully participate in public life. Health Care Despite the Affordable Care Act\u2019s success in making coverage available for millions and although our country is suffering through the worst health crisis in a century, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments about the constitutionality of the ACA just one week after the election.

[ 36 ] New York Post reporting On October 14, 2020, the New York Post published articles containing purported emails of unknown authorship which suggested that Hunter Biden provided an \"opportunity\" to Vadym Pozharskyi, an advisor to the board of Burisma, to meet his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden. [ 2 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Joe Biden stated in September 2019 that he had never spoken to his son about his foreign business dealings. [ 39 ] His presidential campaign denied such a meeting took place and stated the New York Post had never contacted them \"about the critical elements of this story\". [ 40 ] Michael Carpenter, Vice President Biden's foreign policy adviser in 2015, told The Washington Post that he had accompanied Joe Biden during all of his meetings about Ukraine: \"He never met with [Pozharskyi]. In fact, I had never heard of this guy until the New York Post story broke.\" [ 41 ] One of the purported emails showed Pozharskyi saying he would share information with Amos Hochstein , a State Department advisor close to Vice President Biden, though Hochstein stated, \"The Republican Senate investigation subpoenaed all my records, including emails and calendars and found no mention of this man. I led the US energy efforts in Ukraine and never even heard of him before yesterday.\" [ 42 ] According to an investigation by The New York Times, editors at the New York Post \"pressed staff members to add their bylines to the story\", and at least one refused, in addition to the original author, reportedly because of a lack of confidence in its credibility. Of the two writers eventually credited on the article, the second did not know her name was attached to it until after The Post published it. [ 33 ] In its opening sentence, the New York Post story misleadingly asserted, \"the elder Biden pressured government officials in Ukraine into firing a prosecutor who was investigating\" Burisma, even though Shokin had not pursued an investigation into Burisma's founder. [ 41 ] The opening sentence also misleadingly stated that Hunter Biden introduced his father to Pozharskyi, but the purported email from Pozharskyi only mentioned an invitation and \"opportunity\" for the men to meet. [ 43 ] [ 44 ] On October 15, the Post published another article regarding a business venture relating to\nIn Wisconsin Speech, Pence Calls Biden A 'Trojan Horse' For Socialism - WPR Vice President Mike Pence called his Democratic opponents socialists and warned that presumptive nominee Joe Biden was a \u201cTrojan horse for a radical agenda\u201d in a speech Friday at Wisconsin\u2019s Ripon College. Pence touted the economy of the first three years of the Trump administration, and said Trump took \u201cextraordinary action\u201d to combat the COVID-19 pandemic this year. But the bulk of the address, which was billed as a \u201cmajor speech\u201d by Trump campaign officials, focused on defining Biden as an agent of the radical left. Pence connected Biden to former Democratic primary candidate Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and other self-identified democratic socialists in the party.

URL This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. Email \u201cOur road leads to greater freedom and opportunity,\u201d Pence said. \u201cTheir road leads to socialism and decline.\u201d Biden was perceived as a moderate candidate in the Democratic primary, defeating candidates like Sanders who called for more dramatic policy shifts on health care and economic inequality. The Biden campaign recently released a policy document under the name \u201cBiden-Sanders Unity Task Force\u201d that laid out new proposals intended to combat climate change and reform the nation\u2019s criminal justice system . Of the document, Pence said, \u201cthe only thing it ended up unifying was Joe Biden to the radical left.\u201d The Biden campaign blasted Pence\u2019s visit ahead of the speech. In a statement, deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said that \u201cthe Trump campaign is once again sending Vice President Mike Pence to the Badger State to do damage control for this administration\u2019s historic failure of leadership.\u201d Recent polls show Biden with a clear lead in Wisconsin. Polling averages find Biden is leading Trump in the state by about 7 points . In response to the national wave of protests that followed the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police, Pence called it a \u201cfalse choice\u201d to say that supporting police is in conflict with \u201cstanding with our African American neighbors.\u201d He repeatedly emphasized the Trump administration\u2019s support for police, and criticized Biden for saying that systemic racism was real and that police have implicit bias against Black people. \u201cWe will stand with those\nBiden and the Burisma advisor Vadym Pozharskyi. The Biden campaign denied Joe Biden had any meeting with Pozharskyi and said that if they had ever met, it would have been a brief encounter. [ 28 ] Witnesses at the dinner where they allegedly met said Joe Biden briefly passed by to see an old friend. The Post reported in its story that Pozharskyi declined to comment, and he did not comment to a Politico journalist who reported extensively on the story a year later. [ 29 ] The Post reported that the email was found in a cache of data extracted from the external hard drive of a laptop computer that belonged to Hunter Biden. The Post reported that the repair shop owner had made a copy of the external hard drive before it was seized by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and that the copy was later provided to the Post by Donald Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani . The subpoena to seize the laptop was issued by a grand jury on behalf of the US attorney's office in Wilmington, which was later reported to have been investigating Hunter Biden about lobbying and financial matters since at least 2018. [ 1 ] [ 12 ] The veracity of the Post 's reporting was strongly questioned by many mainstream media outlets and analysts due to the initially unclear origin and chain of custody of the laptop and the provenance of its contents. Due to prior Russian influence campaigns during the 2016 election, particularly the release of documents obtained by Russian cyber attacks targeting John Podesta and the Democratic National Committee , media outlets and intelligence officials also became suspicious of a possible disinformation campaign by Russian intelligence or its proxies. Analysts also suspected Russian involvement in the 2017 leaks of emails involving French president Emmanuel Macron two days before national elections, which contained fake emails mingled with genuine ones. [ 30 ] Adding to concerns, Giuliani had met with Andrii Derkach , later confirmed to be a Russian agent, [ 31 ] [ 32 ] while conducting opposition research against Joe Biden in Ukraine in 2019.

Different versions of the claim suggest they were FBI operatives or members of the anti-fascist movement antifa . \"Earlier today, the Capitol was under siege by people who can only be described as antithetical to the MAGA movement,\" Laura Ingraham said on her Fox News show the night of Jan. 6, referring to Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" slogan. \"They were likely not all Trump supporters, and there are some reports that antifa sympathizers may have been sprinkled throughout the crowd.\" The next day, Ingraham acknowledged the inaccuracy when she tweeted a link to a story debunking the claim. Another Fox host, Tucker Carlson, has spread the idea that the FBI orchestrated the riot. He cites as evidence the indictments of some Jan. 6 suspects that mention unindicted co-conspirators, a common legal term that merely refers to suspects who haven't been charged, and not evidence of undercover agents or informants. Yet Carlson claimed on his show that \"in potentially every single case, they were FBI operatives.\" Carlson is a \"main driver\" of the idea that Jan. 6 was perpetrated by agents of the government, according to Zignal's report. It found the claim spiked in October when Carlson released a documentary series about the insurrection. Members of Congress, including Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., have helped spread the theories. \"Some of the people who breached the Capitol today were not Trump supporters, they were masquerading as Trump supporters and, in fact, were members of the violent terrorist group antifa,\" Gaetz said. Spokespeople for Carlson and Gaetz say they stand by their claims. In truth, the rioters are just who they said they were .

Evans streamed video of himself illegally entering the Capitol. \"They're making an announcement now saying if Pence\nterrorist attack and he currently in prison serving two life sentences without the possibility of parole. In response to the deadly violence perpetrated by Fields, Trump claimed that there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d and in the first presidential debate refused to condemn violent right-wing groups. His remarks were widely criticized. Are they really a threat? At least one death has been attributed to a person affiliated wth the Antifa movement. On August 29, a member of the far-right group \u201cPatriot Prayer\u201d who was part of a pro-Trump caravan in Portland, Oregon, died after being shot . The man accused of the killing, Michael Reinoehl, was shot by US marshals five days later. Overall, however, data show that Antifa activists have been involved in relatively few violent incidents compared to white supremacists, who have conducted at least 40 lethal attacks since 2018 according to the Department of Homeland Security. Despite this, Trump and his attorney general, William Barr, have accused the Antifa movement of being the main instigators of violence, looting and public unrest. This is what serves as justification for the administration\u2019s labeling them as \u201ca domestic terrorist group\u201d. For both legal and political reasons, such accusations are immediately met with scepticism and criticism. Because the United States has no domestic terror law \u2013 something opposed by both progressive and conservative public officials \u2013 the only possibility would be to place the Antifa movement on the list of \u201cforeign terrorist organizations\u201d, something that has no basis in fact. The alternative would be take thousands of activists to court, thus criminalizing political beliefs and violating fundamental rights guaranteed by the US Constitution. A polarized country So does the Antifa movement represent a real threat to American democracy? Let us look more broadly at the partisan, political conflict that is being felt across the country. The Antifa movement is part of a polarization of political views that is eroding one the foundations of the American republic, the mutual recognition of the legitimacy of both political sides. The groups against which the Antifa movement positions itself, including white supremacists, neo-fascists and right-wing nationalists , have been involved in numerous violent actions and killings . However, the Antifa movement\u2019s own actions can contribute to the legitimization of violence, escalate conflicts rather than defuse them, and expose peaceful protesters to danger. Calls for violence , whatever the source, can also be used\n1 Person Dead In Shooting That Followed Day Of Far-Right, Far-Left Rallies In Denver : NPR Accessibility links Skip to main content Keyboard shortcuts for audio player 1 Person Dead In Shooting That Followed Day Of Far-Right, Far-Left Rallies In Denver Police said a private security guard was taken into custody as a suspect in connection with the shooting.

The shooting came at the end of a day of competing rallies by far-right and far-left demonstrators. Helen H. Richardson/MediaNews Group/The Denver Post via Getty Images One person was killed and another man is in police custody after a fatal shooting in Denver on Saturday that occurred toward the end of dueling rallies by activists on the far right and the far left. The Denver Police Department said it had taken a private security guard into custody in connection with the shooting. On Sunday, the department identified the suspect as 30-year-old Matthew Dolloff. He has not been formally charged. A local news channel, 9News, said it had contracted Dolloff through the Pinkerton security firm as a guard to accompany staff covering the protest. Contracting private security to protect reporters and producers at protests has been a practice at the outlet for several months, 9News said. The shooting took place near the Denver Art Museum when competing far-left and far-right protests were winding down nearby. Activists from the far left were in the area for a Black Lives Matter Anti-Fascist Soup Drive organized by the Denver Communists, the Colorado Socialist Revolution and other groups, according to Colorado Public Radio . The right-wing demonstrators had gathered for what was billed as a Patriot Muster organized by John \"Tig\"\n7, 2021 That man was later identified as Jake Angeli, a noted supporter of a conspiracy cult called Qanon and a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump. Angeli is a well-known protester covered previously by Arizona Central . Supporters had planned the events online , using social media apps like Parler to express support for the rallies scheduled on Thursday. Other false claims also indicated that Antifa protestors were \u201cescorted\u201d into the Capitol by police to cause the disruption. Metropolitan police denied the claim, telling Reuters they do not act as a private security escort. If the identification of well-known right-wing activists is not convincing enough to dispel the notion that Antifa was involved in the Capitol, consider Trump\u2019s own messages to the rioters he was telling to go home. \u201cWe love you, you\u2019re very special,\u201d he told them in a video that was later taken down by Twitter and Facebook. \u201cBut go home, and go home in peace.\u201d Copyright 2021 by KSAT - All rights reserved.

Johnson has since said that he doesn't want the violent actions of a few to be used to impugn all. Rep. Andrew Clyde, after watching video footage of rioters walking through the Capitol, said it resembled a \"normal tourist visit.\" Other video evidence from Jan. 6 showed Clyde, R-Ga., helping barricade the House doors in an attempt to keep the rioters out. Trump called the insurrection a display of \" spirit and faith and love .\" Rioters also broke windows and doors, stole items from offices and caused an estimated $1.5 million in damage. Outside the Capitol someone set up a gallows with a noose . \"The notion that this was somehow a tourist event is disgraceful and despicable,\" Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said in May. \"And, you know, I won't be part of whitewashing what happened on Jan. 6. Nobody should be part of it. And people ought to be held accountable.\" ___ CLAIM: TRUMP DID NOT ENCOURAGE THE RIOTERS Trump may now want to minimize his involvement, but he spent months sounding a steady drumbeat of conspiracy theory and grievance, urging his followers to fight to somehow return him to power. \"Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,\" Trump tweeted on Dec. 19, 2020. \"Be there, will be wild!\" Immediately before the mob stormed the Capitol, Trump spoke for more than an hour, telling his supporters they had been \"cheated\" and \"defrauded\" in the \"rigged\" election by a \"criminal enterprise\" that included lawmakers who were now meeting in the Capitol. At one point, Trump did urge his supporters to \"peacefully and patriotically make your voice heard.\" The rest of his speech was filled with hostile rhetoric. \"We fight. We fight like hell,\" he told those who would later break into the Capitol. \"And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\" Now, Trump says he had nothing to do with the riot. \"I wasn't involved in that, and if you look at my words and what I said in the speech, they were extremely calming actually,\" Trump said on Fox News in December. Nearly two-thirds of Americans believe Trump bears some responsibility for the Capitol breach, according to a survey last year by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. ___ CLAIM: ASHLI BABBITT WAS KILLED BY AN"}], "source": "rag_only"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 5, "concluded_by_rag": true, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.0}

Bloom\u2019s mother, Gloria Allred, is an attorney representing several women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct . Trump had been given a tentative court date for the civil lawsuit of 16 December and has denied all the accusations made against him. After Doe\u2019s suit was filed in June , Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, told the Guardian the claims were \u201ca complete fabrication\u201d. \u201cThis is basically a sham lawsuit brought by someone who desires to impact the presidential election,\u201d he said.

On May 9, 2023, a New York jury in a civil case found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation against Carroll, but found him not liable for rape. They awarded Carroll US $5 million in damages. [ 20 ] In July 2023, Judge Kaplan stated that the jury had found that Trump had raped Carroll according to the common definition of the word as they had ruled that Trump had forcibly and nonconsensually penetrated Carroll's vagina with his fingers. [ 21 ] New York state's definition at the time defined rape as solely nonconsensual penetration of the vagina by a penis.

[ 26 ] The allegations by Ivana Trump and Jill Harth became public before Trump's presidential candidacy with the rest going public after the 2005 Access Hollywood tape was leaked during the 2016 presidential campaign in which Trump was recorded bragging that a celebrity like himself \"can do anything\" to women, including \"just start kissing them ... I don't even wait\" and \"grab 'em by the pussy \". Trump denied behaving that way toward women and apologized for the crude language. Many of his accusers stated that Trump's denials provoked them into going public. Several former Miss USA and Miss Teen USA contestants accused Trump of entering the dressing rooms of beauty pageant contestants while contestants were in various stages of undress. Trump had already referred to this practice during a 2005 interview on The Howard Stern Show , saying he could \"get away with things like that\" because he owned the Miss Universe franchise. In October 2019, the book All the President's Women: Donald Trump and the\nDonald Trump sexual misconduct allegations - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Since the 1970s, at least 28 women have accused Donald Trump of various acts of sexual misconduct, [ 1 ] including rape, kissing and groping without consent, looking under women's skirts, and walking in on naked teenage pageant contestants.

The most recent, from writer and columnist E. Jean Carroll, appeared in NY Magazine on Friday. The women's charges range from unwanted touches and aggressive, sudden kissing to the latest accusation against Trump -- that he attacked a woman in a dressing room and forced his penis inside her. Donald Trump, his campaign and the Trump White House have insisted all of the stories are fabricated and politically motivated. So far: 16 women have accused Donald Trump of various forms of sexual assault, including one accusation of rape and another, in which the accuser has not used the word \"rape\" but whose description meets the legal definition of rape. This figure includes standing accusations from both before and after the release of the Access Hollywood tape on October 7, 2016. Four other women have publicly said Mr. Trump walked in on them and other pageant contestants while they were undressing. Buzzfeed reports another three women have confirmed the pageant stories but did not want their names used. The alleged incidents range from the early 1980s to 2013. Donald Trump has adamantly denied all of the stories and accuses the women of being political tools who were trying to undermine either his candidacy or presidency.

As Jacob built the company, a \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d movement was growing in the wake of news stories of multiple officers shot to death in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Brooklyn, New York; and Dallas, Texas. Meanwhile, Donald Trump, as a presidential candidate, called police \u201cthe force between civilization and total chaos.\u201d Some states began passing laws to categorize physical attacks on law enforcement officers as hate crimes. Police were not actually in greater danger than they had been before the Black Lives Matter movement. Ambush killings of police have actually declined more than 90 percent since 1970, even with the recent spikes, according to a study by Michael White, a professor of criminology at Arizona State University. White understands how the thin blue line flag has become a part of police culture, and that officers may view it as a sign of solidarity, but he also worries about the message it sends to the public. \u201cIt fosters this \u2018us versus them\u2019 mentality,\u201d he said. \u201cThe police and community together should work together, in order to produce safety. Each should respect the role of the other. If you\u2019re looking at the community as a potential enemy, or a threat, that\u2019s certainly going to hinder any positive relationship.\u201d The idea of a \u201cthin blue line\u201d can be traced all the way back to an 1854 British battle formation, a \u201cthin red line\u201d used during the Crimean War and then popularized in\nfrom the last several Wisconsin rallies that Trump has held in other cities. In Janesville, on Oct. 17, the flag was featured on one side of the stage, while a larger American flag was featured on the other side of the stage, photos from the Journal Sentinel showed . In Mosinee on Sept. 17, Trump spoke in front of Air Force One and no flags were prominently displayed, according to photos by the Journal Sentinel . So the portion of the post that says that the flag was featured prominently \u2014 and more prominently than at earlier rallies \u2014 is on the money. But what about the meaning of the flag? A controversial flag meant to support police officers The flag has been popularized by the company \u201cThin Blue Line USA,\u201d which also sells clothing emblazoned with the symbol. According to the company\u2019s website, the flag is meant to be a sign for \u201cpromoting compassion and support for our nation\u2019s police officers.\u201d The company began marketing the flag in 2014, amid the Blue Lives Matter movement , which itself was launched in response to the Black Lives Matter movement. The Black Lives Matter movement arose in 2013, after the acquittal of George Zimmerman, who killed teen Trayvon Martin in Florida, according to the movement\u2019s website . Black Lives Matter has been invoked around the country this year during massive protests that were launched after the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers. In a June 8 article by the Marshall Project, \u201c The Short, Fraught History of the \u2018Thin Blue Line\u2019 American Flag ,\u201d Andrew Jacob, president of Thin Blue Line USA said: \u201cThe flag has no association with racism, hatred, bigotry. It\u2019s a flag to show support for law enforcement \u2014 no politics involved.\u201d According to the article: \"Jacob said the flag was not a direct reaction to the first Black Lives Matter protests \u2014 an idea suggested by a previous origin story in Harper\u2019s \u2014 but he allows he may have first seen the thin blue line image after those protests spurred the circulation of pro-police imagery online.

'That\u2019s maybe why it came to my eyes,' he said.\" Whatever the intended meaning of the flag, it has come to carry different connotations to different people At protests in Charlottesville in 2017, where white supremacist groups and supporters gathered to protest the removal of Confederate statues throughout the country, the blue-line flag was featured alongside Confederate flags, according to an Aug. 18, 2017, report from USA TODAY . (The company disavowed its use in Charlottesville.) A July 31 NPR report highlighted a fight between a Massachusetts fire department flying the flags in honor of fallen police officers and community members who felt the flag was an overt display of racism. A June 9 Politico report said even police officers have mixed reactions to the symbol, with some departments banning it outright, while others display it on government-owned vehicles. The Politico report also noted that the flag is controversial because of its likeness to the American flag, and because of the U.S. Flag Code, which states: \u201cThe (American) flag should never have placed upon it, nor any part of it, nor attached to it any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture or drawing of any nature.\u201d When asked why the flag was placed behind the president, Wisconsin Trump Victory \u2014 the state\u2019s Trump campaign group \u2014 did not respond. To be sure, it is possible to support police officers and the Black Lives Matter movement. But Trump himself has been harshly critical of the Black Lives Matter protests this summer, labeling them as violent and claiming they were stoked by anti-government elements. Our rating: True We rate this claim TRUE based on our research. The image and description \u2014 that the flag has taken on greater prominence at the Trump rallies in Wisconsin \u2014 is on target. And the Thin Blue Line flag has become a prominent part of the pro-police Blue Lives Matter movement, which arose to counter the Black Lives Matter movement. That said, while it is possible to support both, Trump has made clear he opposes the Black Lives Matter protests \u2014 and made that opposition, and a strong law-and-order message, a prominent part of his reelection campaign. So, those attending the rally or seeing the images could easily see the flag as an \u201canti Black Lives Matter flag.\u201d Our fact-check sources Facebook post by The Other 98%, Oct. 25 Tweet by\nuntil my very last day.\u201d Social media allows for endless remixing, and the offerings now appear infinite. You can buy a sticker that mixes the imagery with the Disney World logo. You can buy a dog tag necklace, with Matthew 5:9 engraved on the back: \u201cBlessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.\u201d Law enforcement officers can buy a special edition Sig Sauer pistol covered with the flag and blue line. But as the images have multiplied, so have the meanings. The American flag and blue line have often been blended with the image of a skull associated with the Punisher comic book hero. A Marine turned vigilante who first appeared in Marvel comics in 1974, the Punisher fought crime through extrajudicial murder and torture. \u201cPolice should not be embracing a criminal as their symbol,\u201d the character\u2019s creator, Gerry Conway, told Syfy Wire last year. \u201cIn a way, it\u2019s as offensive as putting a Confederate flag on a government building.\u201d Although the flag\u2019s manufacturers have tried to keep politics away from the flag, the current protests over the death of George Floyd have thrust the image into larger debates. In Cold Spring, New York, local leaders debated last week whether placing a decal of the flag on a police car would make some people afraid to ask officers for help. In Montclair, New Jersey, a police leader begged residents on a Zoom call not to view the flag as a \u201csymbol of racism.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve seen trucks riding around with big old versions,\u201d said Melina Abdullah, a co-founder of the Los Angeles chapter of Black Lives Matter, about the protests in recent days. \u201cIt feels akin to a Confederate flag.\u201d She has also noticed the flag\u2019s image on police and other government-owned vehicles, and she sees this as evidence that even self-described liberal officials are not doing enough to combat white supremacy. \u201cThe supposed \u2018liberal\u2019 answer to Donald Trump has not been as critical of police violence as it should be,\u201d she said. Police officers themselves are also not speaking uniformly about the flag. Over the summer San Francisco\u2019s chief of police, Bill Scott, banned his officers from wearing face masks emblazoned with the thin blue line flag, worrying they would be seen as \u201cdivisive and disrespectful.\u201d The masks had been distributed by the local police union, which accused the department of failing to provide masks. \u201cWe\nand made that opposition, and a strong law-and-order message, a prominent part of his reelection campaign. So, those attending the rally or seeing the images could easily see the flag as an \u201canti Black Lives Matter flag.\u201d Our fact-check sources Facebook post by The Other 98%, Oct. 25 Tweet by Jeff Sharlet , Oct. 24 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Oct. 24, \u201c Donald Trump continues Wisconsin push, hoping he can replicate 2016 formula \" Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Oct. 17, \u201c Trump tells thousands in Janesville that Wisconsin is key to winning \u2018the whole ball game '\" Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Sept. 17, \u201c Donald Trump tears into Joe Biden in return visit to Wisconsin \" Thin Blue Line USA, About page , accessed Oct. 26 USA TODAY, Aug. 18, \u201c\u2018 Thin Blue Line\u2019: What does an American flag with a blue line mean? \u201d Blacklivesmatter.com , accessed Oct. 27 Politico, June 9, \u201c The short fraught history of the \u2018Thin Blue Line\u2019 American flag \" The Marshall Project, June 28, \u201c The Short, Fraught History of the \u2018Thin Blue Line\u2019 American Flag\" Thank you for supporting our journalism.

But Trump's backers have seized upon the comments, making comparisons with a controversial remark by Hillary Clinton in 2016 during Trump's first run for office, when she said half of Trump's supporters were from a \"basket of deplorables\". As the war of words escalated, Trump himself suggested Kamala Harris - his rival for the White House - was running a \"campaign of hate\".

This new virus was first identified in the city of Wuhan in the Hubei province 1 . Since then, it has spread to over 203 countries, and was officially declared as a global pandemic illness by the World Health Organization (WHO) 2 . After almost 2 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has left a toll of 446 million infected and more than 6.0 million deaths worldwide 3 . From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of facemasks (FMs) has been controversial due to political, cultural and economic causes. However, multiple studies have highlighted the efficiency of FM in the reduction of COVID-19 transmission (i.e., from 6 to 80%) 4 . In another report the use of medical/surgical masks reduced the transmission rates by 85% 5 . Countries worldwide have adapted many different approaches to control the disease 6 . Non-pharmaceutical actions included the use gowns, gloves, and FM, all of which have been proven to be effective and more recently, the use of vaccines such as the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine, Curevac, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Sino pharm has proven effective in the control of the pandemic 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 . Some side effects associated with the use of FMs have been reported. The most common side effect described by healthcare workers was bilateral headaches (affecting up to 80% of users), dermatitis, itchy rash and elevated heart rates 11 . However, the WHO has advised populations to wear FMs on a large scale only excluding patients with limited respiratory conditions 4 . Recently updated guidelines issued by the WHO advised the use of FMs as part of its prevention recommendations which also included hand hygiene, physical distance of at least 1 m, avoidance of face touching and adequate indoor ventilation 2 , 12 . Previous clinical studies have addressed the potential impact of FMs on brain and cognitive functions 13 , 14 . One study in healthy young people showed that the 150-min use of surgical mask had no significant mental fatigue perception 13 while another showed that the prolonged use of FMs can result in headache and impaired"}], "source": "rag_only"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 5, "concluded_by_rag": true, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.0}

Dan Evon Published Sept. 14, 2020 Reed Hastings spricht auf der re:publica 2015 am 05.05.2015 in Berlin..Copyright: re:publica/Gregor Fischer (Image courtesy of Wikipedia) Claim: Netflix CEO Reed Hastings was arrested on suspicion of possessing child pornography. Rating: False About this rating In September 2020, as social media users accused Netflix of promoting pedophilia due to a promotional poster for the award-winning French film \"Cuties,\" the website TorontoToday.net published an article claiming that Reed Hastings, the streaming service's CEO, had been arrested on suspicion of possession of child pornography: This is not a genuine news report. Hastings was not arrested by the FBI, and the accusations circulating on social media that the Netflix CEO was involved in child pornography are baseless and largely driven by pedophilia panic that consumed portions of the internet in 2020. Hasting is the CEO of one of the world's largest streaming services. If he truly had been arrested by the FBI, it would certainly warrant a press release from the FBI, and would undoubtedly make headlines in credible media outlets. However, the only source for this news appears to be random social media posts and an article published to a website with a history of spreading misinformation. TorontoToday.net is a relatively new website, but it has already been responsible for at least two viral hoaxes. Shortly after Black Panther actor Chadwick Boseman died from colon cancer, the website published a false report claiming that he had been poisoned. The website was also responsible for the false rumor that Russian President Vladimir Putin's daughter had died from a COVID-19 vaccine. The website deleted its false report about Hasting's arrest, but an archived version of the page can be found here . It appears that TorontoToday.net originally published this article under the headline \"Netflix CEO gets BUSTED with 13,000 files of CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.\" Then, the site updated the article to include the word \"reports\" before the headline, and deleted the original text of the article claiming a\nFact check: False claim that Netflix CEO Reed Hastings arrested FACT CHECK fact-checking Add Topic Fact check: False claim that Netflix CEO Reed Hastings was arrested for child pornography Camille Caldera USA TODAY Sept. 17, 2020, 1:36 p.m. ET The claim: Netflix CEO Reed Hastings was arrested for child pornography Netflix has faced significant backlash \u2014 including from Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton, and Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard \u2014 over its recent release of the film \"Cuties,\" which has been criticized for sexualizing young girls. Amid the controversy, unfounded claims about Netflix CEO Reed Hastings have swirled on social media. Posts on Facebook and Instagram included a screenshot of a headline that claimed \"Netflix CEO gets BUSTED with 13,000 files of CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.\" The headline came from an article on the webpage Toronto Today. The story \u2014 which was archived on Sept. 12 prior to its removal from the site \u2014 claimed that Hastings was arrested at his home in California and faces \"11 charges related to the seizure of more than 13,000 files of graphic child pornography on his computer and various removable storage units.\" The users behind the posts did not respond to requests from USA TODAY for comment. Toronto Today denied being the original source of the false story, and noted in an email to USA TODAY that Netflix and Hastings have faced accusations of distributing child pornography since the release of \"Cuties.\" Story is false, details taken from an unrelated arrest of someone else in December 2019 The claims in the screenshots and the story from Toronto Today are false. No reputable media outlets reported the alleged arrest, and no law enforcement agencies \u2014 including the Federal Bureau of Investigations, which the article claims made the arrest \u2014 issued any press releases or statements to that effect. Numerous details in the article by Toronto Today appeared to be lifted from a report on ABC4 in December 2019, which detailed the arrest of Douglas Saltsman, a Utah CEO. Copied details include the number and content of the files, including the age of children and the nature of the sexual abuse, and evidence of a \"clandestine drug lab\" discovered during the raid.

Hastings has not been charged with child pornography. See the sources for this fact-check If you\u2019ve been binge-watching Netflix shows to get through the lows of the coronavirus pandemic, you might have been shocked to see online claims about the alleged criminal behavior of the company\u2019s CEO. \"Kim Martin Morrow the CEO of Netflix has just been charged with 15 charges for child pornography and 31,000 files have been found on his personal computers for child porn from ages 8 and as young as toddlers,\" reads the text of a post that has been copied numerous times on different social media platforms. \"So, I think the investigation was needed. #SaveOurChildren.\" The text often accompanies a link to a story titled: \"Sen. Ted Cruz calls for a criminal investigation into Netflix film 'Cuties.'\" The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. ( Read more about our partnership with Facebook. ) Netflix\u2019s CEO has not been charged with these crimes. The claims have been debunked several times, but some social media users continue to spread the misinformation. Netflix CEO First, the claim incorrectly identifies Netflix\u2019s CEO. Reed Hastings is the CEO and co-founder of Netflix. PolitiFact searched news archives and found no evidence that Hastings had been charged with any crime. It\u2019s not clear where the name \u2018Kim Martin Morrow\u2019 originated; our searches find it solely used with these inaccurate claims. Not one of Netflix\u2019s eight senior officers or 12 directors is named Kim Martin Morrow. So why are social media users falsely linking a fake Netflix CEO to child pornography charges? That\u2019s a bit complicated. Child pornography claims The child pornography claims come after Netflix\u2019s release of the French film \u2018Cuties\u2019 was met with criticism from subscribers and other internet users. Many say the film inappropriately\ncan be found here . It appears that TorontoToday.net originally published this article under the headline \"Netflix CEO gets BUSTED with 13,000 files of CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.\" Then, the site updated the article to include the word \"reports\" before the headline, and deleted the original text of the article claiming a threat of legal action from a \"billionaire we won't name.\" Unfortunately, we have received threats of litigation over the original article posted on Toronto Today from a Billionaire that we won\u2019t name. Upon consideration, we have removed the original article from the website, and from Toronto Today-controlled Facebook and Twitter accounts. It\u2019s not worth the risk. We apologize for any confusion. However, Toronto Today was NOT the original source for this information, nor is it responsible for the negative fallout that the movie \u201cCuties\u201d has caused for Netflix. The updated version of the article has also been deleted. An archived page can be found here . This fake report about the arrest of Netflix CEO Reed Hasting is just the latest in a long series of false rumors concerning pedophilia. In 2020, pedophilia panic consumed portions of the internet, in large part because these false rumors were being amplified by the growing QAnon conspiracy movement. In the last few months alone, we've covered false rumors about furniture stores trafficking children via large cabinets , department stores promoting pedophilia by selling shirts containing images of pizza , and the country of Greece classifying pedophilia as a disability. While pedophilia and sex trafficking are certainly real issues, the aforementioned stories are false. In fact, the National Human Trafficking Hotline released a statement saying that these pedophilia conspiracy theories were making it more difficult to help people who are actually in danger of being trafficked.

It began last August, when violent unrest exploded in Kenosha after a white police officer shot a Black man named Jacob Blake, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. Thousands of demonstrators turned out to protest police brutality, and some destroyed police cars, damaged businesses and burned down several buildings. On Aug. 25, the third night of protests, Rittenhouse, then 17, drove from his home in Illinois across the state line into Wisconsin, where he armed himself with an AR-15-style rifle loaded with 30 rounds. There, Rittenhouse shot and killed Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and injured Gaige Grosskreutz. He faces felony charges of first-degree reckless homicide, first-degree intentional homicide, attempted first-degree intentional homicide and first-degree recklessly endangering safety, along with a pair of lesser charges for possessing a gun as a minor and failure to comply with curfew that night.

At a gas station near the center of the protests, Rosenbaum was acting \"agitated,\" Binger said, \"getting in people's faces\" and \"essentially daring people to respond,\" including others armed with weapons similar to the rifle carried by Rittenhouse.

(Evan Vucci/AP) Sunday, October 4 In the midst of his treatment, Trump briefly left the hospital with his security detail so he could ride past supporters cheering him on outside. From the back of his SUV, Trump waved to his supporters through the window while wearing a mask. Also on Sunday, Conley held a briefing that raised more questions than answers about the President's condition. The White House physician failed to answer basic questions about the President's condition, and he admitted that in his news conference Saturday he had omitted alarming drops in the President's oxygen levels. Conley said it was because he wanted to \"reflect the upbeat attitude\" that the team and the President had about his condition. Conley said the President was \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoing really well\u00e2\u0080\u009d and responding to treatment. Trump waves to supporters from the back of his SUV.

There's no pandemic': Trump's base stays loyal as president fights Covid This article is more than 5 years old News that the president has contracted coronavirus prompted alarm and confusion among Trump supporters in Missouri Sean Patterson is not worried that Donald Trump has been hospitalized with coronavirus because he believes what the president tells him. \u201cIt\u2019s a hoax. There\u2019s no pandemic. As Trump said, how many millions die of flu?\u201d said the 56-year-old truck driver outside the early voting station in St Joseph, Missouri \u2013 a stronghold for the president. But then Patterson pauses and contemplates the possibility that Trump really does have Covid-19. \u201cIf he\u2019s sick, then they planted it when they tested him. It\u2019s what they did to me when I went to hospital for my heart beating too fast. Two weeks later I got a cold,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s political. I don\u2019t trust the US government at all. Who are they to mandate personal safety? I listen to Trump.\u201d At the end of a tumultuous week even by the standards of one of the most turbulent presidencies of modern times, the disturbing if not entirely unpredictable news that the president has contracted coronavirus prompted alarm, confusion and schadenfreude in the heart of Trumpland. St Joseph, a former frontier city where the outlaw Jesse James met his bloody end, voted overwhelmingly for the president four years ago. The polls say Missouri will go his way again next month. But with Trump struggling in key swing states, the news he has fallen sick to Covid-19 jolted an election already battered days earlier by the most undignified presidential election debate in history. 1:21 Trump mocks Biden during first presidential debate: 'I don\u2019t wear a mask like him' \u2013 video Trump\u2019s persistent interruptions and disruptions, including mocking Biden for wearing a mask in other situations,"}], "source": "rag_only"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 5, "concluded_by_rag": true, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.0}

Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests \u2014 (applause) \u2014 in the end, John McCain thought about the beginning. Five years ago, as John was dying from brain cancer, John wrote a farell- \u2014 a farewell letter to the nation that he said \u2014 that he served so well in both war and in peace. His words tracked back centuries to America\u2019s founding and then toward a triumphant future. Here\u2019s what John wrote, and I quote, \u201cWe are citizens of the world \u2014 the world\u2019s greatest republic. A nation of ideals, not blood and soil. Americans never quit. They never hide from history. America makes history.\u201d And John was right. Every other per- \u2014 every other nation in the world has been founded on either a grouping by ethnicity, religion, background. We\u2019re the most unique nation in the world. We\u2019re founded on an idea \u2014 the only major nation in the world founded on an idea. An idea that we are all created equal, endowed by our Cr- \u2014 in the image of God, endowed by our Creator to be \u2014 to be able to be treated equally throughout our lives. We\u2019ve never fully lived up to that idea, but we\u2019ve never walked away from it. But there\u2019s danger we\u2019re walking too far away from it now, the way we talk in this deba- \u2014 in this country. Because a long line of patriots from \u2014 like John McCain kept it from ever becoming something other than what it is. I often think about our friendship of 40 years. The hammer-and-tong debates we\u2019d have in the Senate. We\u2019d argue \u2014 we were like two brothers. We\u2019d argue like hell. (Laughs.) I mean really go at one another.

But, look, running on opposite sides of the nation\u2019s highest office when \u2014 when he was running for president and I was on the vice presidential ticket \u2014 we still remained friends.

Harris told reporters that she \u201cstrongly\u201d disagrees with criticizing people based on who they vote for.

You heard my speech last night and continuously throughout my career. I believe that the work that I do is about representing all the people whether they support me or not,\u201d Harris said on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews. The vice president also repeated what she has said on the trail, including that she will \u201crepresent all Americans\u201d if elected. \u201cI am sincere in what I mean: When elected president of the United States, I will represent all Americans, including those who don\u2019t vote for me, and address their needs and their desires,\u201d Harris said. The president inadvertently injected himself into the home stretch of the campaign on Tuesday night when he was attempting to criticize Trump\u2019s rally at Madison Square Garden over the weekend. Biden mentioned Puerto Rico, which was referred to as a \u201cfloating island of garbage\u201d by a comedian at Trump\u2019s event on Sunday night.

He said that job creation and the economy were top concerns, noting that \u201cyoung voters are still voters.\u201d Still, Lobel also said that especially important to his age group are Biden administration efforts to cancel student debt for millions of Americans, protect abortion rights and promote green energy and public works projects around the country. \u201cAs GenZers, these are the numbers we care about,\u201d Lobel said. \u201cWe\u2019re voting based on what he\u2019s delivering for us.\u201d View Comments Featured Weekly Ad\ntogether, we will defeat Donald Trump and continue to build a future that works for every single American,\" said Biden's reelection campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, in a statement first shared with The Associated Press. Joining Voters of Tomorrow formally supporting Biden is NextGen PAC, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, Blue Future, Jr. Newtown Action Alliance, Path to Progress, Students Demand Action, Team ENOUGH, Voices of Gen-Z and Dream for America. They are doing so with more traditional, party-aligned youth organizations, the Young Democrats of America, College Democrats of America, Democratic Youth Coalition, Grassroots Dems HQ and High School Democrats of America. Monday's announcement follows similar joint endorsements the Biden campaign received last year from labor unions, environmental activists, abortion rights advocates and gun safety proponents \u2014 and some of the endorsing youth organizations are affiliated with groups that already backed the president in previously. The president's campaign said that the earlier endorsements were the first of their kind to be made jointly and so early in the cycle. Monday\u2019s announcement is coming later, but still gives young supporters eight months to mobilize behind Biden now that it\u2019s clear he\u2019ll face Trump in November. Trump and top Republicans have blasted Biden as being too old to handle a second term. A Super PAC backing the former president released an ad bluntly declaring, \u201cIf Biden wins, can he even survive till 2029?\u201d That's despite Trump making gaffes himself lately, including suggesting he's running against Barack Obama. But Aalayah Eastmond, a survivor of the 2018 Parkland school shooting in Florida and co-founder of Team ENOUGH, said Biden\u2019s age wasn\u2019t a consideration in the endorsement given that \u201cour only concern is whether we go forward or backward on one of the most pressing issues of our time.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s most important to America\u2019s youth is having a president who listens to our concerns and knows how to deliver on solutions that improve our lives,\u201d Eastmound said. The activist groups plan to pool resources to hire hundreds of young organizers, mobilize affiliates and chapters on 1,000-plus campuses and at state and local levels, and make more than 155 million direct voter contacts via phone calls, texts or in person, Lobel said.

Related Content Health Del. leaders face divided backlash over reopening houses of worship Some religious leaders say they should have the freedom to worship without restrictions, while others say it\u2019s too soon to open under any conditions. 6 years ago Listen 1:38 \u201cIt is safe to reopen your churches if you do so in accordance with the guidelines,\u201d said White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. Public health agencies have generally advised people to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people and encouraged Americans to remain 6 feet (1.8 meters) away from others when possible. Some parts of the country remain under some version of a lockdown, including Washington, D.C. Trump stressed the importance of churches in many communities and took issue with other businesses and services that have been allowed to continue to operate. \u201cSome governors have\nlaw respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d Further, the New York State Constitution states, \u201cThe free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever be allowed in this state to all humankind.\u201d \"Mayor de Blasio surely didn\u2019t mean what he said, because there\u2019s no way he or any other government official would ever have the power to shut down a church, synagogue, or mosque permanently,\u201d said Mark Rienzi, president of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. Rienzi said that, given the context, the mayor \u201cappears to be talking about the temporary need to ensure proper social distancing in a time of crisis,\u201d which Rienzi said was a \u201cvalid governmental interest.\u201d Rienzi called the phrasing of de Blasio\u2019s comments \u201cunfortunate,\u201d and said they were not helping to soothe the fears of religious groups, particularly as those same religious groups are providing emergency relief work to those impacted by COVID-19. \u201cRight now, we need religious groups and the government to continue working together to keep everyone as safe as possible,\u201d said Rienzi. \u201cThe First Amendment will protect against any needless targeting of religious groups in a time of crisis.\u201d religious freedom New York City Becket Fund for Religious Liberty Bill De Blasio Coronavirus\nwas referring to. The recommendations are voluntary. \u201cSome governors have deemed liquor stores and abortion clinics essential, but have left out churches and houses of worship. It\u2019s not right. So I\u2019m correcting this injustice and calling houses of worship essential,\u201d Trump said during his announcement at the White House. Trump said he was calling upon governors to \u201callow churches and places of worship to open right now.\u201d \u201cIf there\u2019s any question, they\u2019re going to have to call me, but they\u2019re not going to be successful in that call,\u201d Trump added. \u201cThe governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important essential places of faith to open right now, this weekend. If they don\u2019t do it, I will override the governors,\u201d he continued. Later in the briefing, White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx and White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany underscored that reopening was at the discretion of governors and religious leaders. \u201cI think each one of the leaders in the faith community should be in touch with their local health department so they can communicate to their congregants. Certainly, people that have significant comorbidities, we want them protected. I know those houses of worship want to protect them,\u201d Birx said. \u201cMaybe they can\u2019t go this week if there\u2019s high numbers of Covid cases. Maybe they wait another week. But there is a way to social distance \u2026 in places of worship.\u201d McEnany, asked about Birx\u2019s response, said the decision to reopen based on the new federal guidance is \u201cup to the governors.\u201d McEnany would not explain what authority Trump would use to \u201coverride\u201d governors\u2019 decisions to keep places of worship closed. The new guidance released by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Friday recommends religious institutions provide soap and hand sanitizer, encourage the use of cloth masks and clean their facilities daily if they want to open while coronavirus is still spreading. These institutions should also promote social distancing and consider limiting the sharing of objects such as books and hymnals, the CDC said. The guidelines also offer leeway to organizations to make their own decisions about what they should do to limit the spread of the virus, and the guidelines are described by the CDC as \u201cgeneral considerations,\u201d \u201csuggestions\u201d and \u201cnon-binding public health guidance for consideration only.\u201d They do not mandate that houses of worship open on Memorial Day weekend. A\nin northern California linked the spread of coronavirus among church members and clergy to Mother\u2019s Day services. A Texas church recently canceled its masses after one of its priests died and five others subsequently tested positive for the coronavirus. The Southern Baptist Convention said Friday it was \u201cpleased\u201d with Trump\u2019s decision. But the Interfaith Alliance and the Council of American-Islamic Relations said Friday that they oppose the call to open places of worship amid the pandemic. CAIR said that American Muslim scholars and community leaders have already determined that public religious activities will be restricted due to the pandemic and that is unlikely to change despite the new guidance. Representatives of two of Judaism\u2019s major branches, Reform and Conservative, said Trump\u2019s declaration does not change their stance and that their members are not expected to hold religious services soon. CNN has also reached out to a representative of the Orthodox branch for comment. This story has been updated with additional developments Friday.

They called the restrictions unconstitutional and unfair since restaurants, malls and bars were allowed limited reopening. Some welcomed the move, including Kelly Shackelford, president of the conservative First Liberty Institute. \u201cThe discrimination that has been occurring against churches and houses of worship has been shocking,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAmericans are going to malls and restaurants. They need to be able to go to their houses of worship.\u201d But Rabbi Jack Moline, president of Interfaith Alliance, said it was \u201ccompletely irresponsible\u201d for Trump to command a mass reopening of houses of worship. \u201cFaith is essential and community is necessary; however, neither requires endangering the people who seek to participate in them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe virus does not discriminate between types of gatherings, and neither should the president.\u201d The CDC more than a month ago sent the Trump administration documents the agency had drafted outlining specific steps various kinds of organizations could follow as they work to reopen safely. The administration first shelved the documents. Eventually, it released guidance for six other types of organizations, but not houses of worship. A Trump administration official had said there were concerns about the propriety of the government interfering with the operation of places of worship. Roger Severino, director of the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services, argued that \u201cprotections against religious discrimination aren\u2019t suspended during an emergency.\u201d Then Trump abruptly reversed course Thursday. \u201cI said, \u2018You better put it out.\u2019 And they\u2019re doing it,\u201d Trump said at a Ford Motor Co. plant repurposed to make ventilators in Michigan. \u201cAnd they\u2019re going to be issuing something today or tomorrow on churches.

Also, states should provide free data package or reimburse the cost of data, which would also require substantial investment to strengthen digital infrastructure including the regular supply of electricity to all households, child right NGO CRY said in a report. \"A clear roadmap with timelines needs to be developed to ensure inclusive digital infrastructure are some of the key measures required for delivering online classes to the last mile child,\" the report released on Tuesday said. The report expressed concern for many of the children who have been excluded from school education during the Covid-19 pandemic and voiced fear that they may not be able to return to schools again. \"Even if they do, a large number of children would not find a level playing field anymore,\" it said. The CRY report also dwelt on the pandemic-triggered disruption in school meal services affecting the nutrition of 6-17 years children. \"As schools are closed across the country, the school feeding programme could no longer provide the much-needed free lunch to 115.9 million children who are enrolled under the Mid-Day Meal (MDM) scheme.

STRAIN IN RELATIONS Relations between Moscow and Washington have been strained in recent year s by everything from Syria to Ukraine to U.S. election interference, something Russia denies. Trump spent two years battling a federal investigation into whether his 2016 campaign colluded with Russia. \"Nothing to see here. Just a Russian military aircraft landing at JFK with 60 tons of medical supplies to support America\u2019s #COVID19 response. A propaganda bonanza as our own government shrinks from America\u2019s leadership role in a global crisis,\" said Brett McGurk, a former American diplomat for Trump and former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush. Trump said on Tuesday he and Putin discussed the virus at length. \"Russia is being hit pretty hard,\" he said. Peskov, Putin's spokesman, said Moscow hoped the United States might also be able to provide medical help to Russia if necessary when the time came. \"It is important to note that when offering assistance to U.S. colleagues, the president (Putin) assumes that when U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials gain momentum, they will also be able to reciprocate if necessary,\" Peskov was cited as saying. Peskov complained that some U.S. officials had made it needlessly difficult to expedite the aid. He also was quoted as saying that Russia and China cooperated in a similar way because \"at a time when the current situation affects everyone without exception ... there is no alternative to working together in a spirit of partnership and mutual assistance.\" Russia has also used its military to send planeloads of aid to Italy to combat the spread of the coronavirus, exposing the European Union's failure to provide swift help to a member in crisis and handing Putin a publicity coup at home and abroad. Reuters Reuters\nPeskov as saying . Peskov also said a Russian plane with medical and protective equipment may leave for the United States on Tuesday. Peskov added that there was an understanding that the United States would return the favor later on . \"It is important to note that when offering assistance to the U.S. colleagues, the president (Putin) assumes that when U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials gain momentum, they will also be able to reciprocate if necessary,\" Peskov was quoted as saying.

The knowledge does not explicitly mention what constitutes \"controversial\" abortion methods, nor does it provide details about the nature of the abortion methods allowed under the legislation.\n\n### Reasoning:\nThe statement claims that \"controversial abortion methods\" are allowed under New Zealand's Abortion Legislation Act (2020). However, the knowledge provided does not clarify what is meant by \"controversial\" and does not detail the specific methods that may be considered controversial. The Act allows qualified health practitioners to provide abortion services up to 20 weeks of pregnancy, but without a clear definition of what \"controversial\" entails, it is difficult to definitively affirm or deny the statement.\n\nThe lack of explicit information on controversial methods in the knowledge does not support the claim that such methods are allowed or that they are a part of the current legal framework. Therefore, the statement is misleading because it implies that there are methods in practice that are deemed controversial without substantiating that with the provided knowledge.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the ambiguity surrounding the term \"controversial\" and the lack of specific information regarding the methods allowed under the Abortion Legislation Act (2020), the statement cannot be confirmed as true. \n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "To meet the obligation under subsection (1)\ufeff(a)\ufeff(i), the Minister of Health must ensure that access to emergency contraception is available throughout New ...\nA qualified health practitioner may provide abortion services to a woman who is not more than 20 weeks pregnant.\nor to stop you from having one.

Since 2020, an average of one baby every month in New Zealand has survived an attempted abortion\u2014yet is denied life-sustaining care. Official government data obtained under the nation\u2019s Official Information Act reveal that approximately 80 such infants were born alive after abortion attempts between 2020 and 2025, at gestations ranging from 20 to 30 weeks. Even more alarming are the policies behind those numbers. Some health districts only consider resuscitation for \u201cwanted babies\u201d after 22 weeks and 5 days, while others defer to parental discretion on whether the child should be treated at all. Family First reports that in one district, the practice has been to \u201cwrap the baby in a blanket and hold it until it passes.\u201d These cases are not isolated tragedies\u2014they mirror a global pattern of failed abortions and infants left without protection . As documented on abortionsurvivors.org , data from around the world show similar outcomes. A 2024 peer-reviewed study in Swiss Medical Weekly analyzing Canadian health data found that among 13,777 second-trimester terminations (15\u201329 weeks), 11.2 percent resulted in live births \u2014a rate that rose sharply with gestational age. Another 2025 analysis published in JAMA revealed that survival rates for infants born at 22 weeks who receive active treatment have climbed from 25.7 percent in 2014 to 41 percent in 2023. These findings confirm what many clinicians and survivors already know: viability is increasing, and the line between \u201cabortion\u201d and \u201cinfanticide\u201d grows thinner with every year that care is withheld. Despite that reality, a 2020 amendment to New Zealand\u2019s abortion law\u2014which would have required life-sustaining treatment for babies born alive\u2014was rejected by nearly two-thirds of MPs. \u201cThis is not about politics\u2014it\u2019s about having a heart,\u201d said Family First NZ CEO Bob McCoskrie. He called for new legislation that mandates equal medical care for all newborns, regardless of the circumstances of birth. At The Abortion Survivors Network , we know these\nrejected by nearly two-thirds of MPs. \u201cThis is not about politics\u2014it\u2019s about having a heart,\u201d said Family First NZ CEO Bob McCoskrie. He called for new legislation that mandates equal medical care for all newborns, regardless of the circumstances of birth. At The Abortion Survivors Network , we know these children exist\u2014because we serve them. Their stories, and those of their mothers, testify that life can and does survive abortion . What happens next is up to us: will governments and medical professionals acknowledge these lives as worthy of protection, or continue to look away? The New Zealand findings join a growing body of international evidence demanding transparency, compassion, and accountability. When a baby survives abortion, the question should never be whether that life deserves care\u2014it should be how quickly we can provide it.

The KNOWLEDGE primarily discusses the legality and ethical considerations surrounding COVID-19 vaccinations in the UK, particularly in the context of employment law and mandates for healthcare workers.\n2. It mentions that vaccinations are generally voluntary in the UK, and while employers can encourage vaccination, they cannot legally mandate it without further legislation.\n3. There is no mention of any political party, including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in India, or any conditions tied to voting behavior and access to COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n**Analysis of the Statement:**\n- The statement claims that individuals who do not vote for the BJP will be denied free access to the COVID vaccine. This implies a political motive and suggests that vaccination access is contingent upon political support, which is not supported by any information in the KNOWLEDGE provided.\n- Furthermore, the KNOWLEDGE does not discuss any such policy or condition related to the BJP or any other political party regarding COVID-19 vaccinations.\n\nGiven that there is no evidence in the KNOWLEDGE to support the claim that voting behavior is linked to vaccine access, we can conclude that the statement is unfounded.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\nThe statement is false as it presents a claim that is not substantiated by any facts or legal frameworks discussed in the provided KNOWLEDGE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "11 November 2021. ]Speak to us to determine the position in regards to notice pay.

If you are faced with a situation where an employee is refusing to get a Covid jab, please call us for a free initial consultation and we would be happy to help. Although everything detailed herein is true, there may be a legal challenge in the future from employees hence why we recommend that care home providers take up legal expenses insurance before dismissing anyone. The statutory provision requiring all staff to be vaccinated (coming into force on 11 November 2021) is at odds with a piece of primary legislation, which should take precedence. Section 129 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 amended the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 (Sections 45C and 45E) which states that \u201cregulations [imposed by the appropriate Minister] may not include a provision requiring a person to undergo medical treatment \u2026 including vaccination.\u201d Therefore there could well be a challenge to any employer who dismisses an employee who refuses to be vaccinated for illegality. It is less likely to be challenged if the dismissal is for a gross misconduct offence (so long as your policies provide for this) but it still could be arguable.

Skip to content Employment Law: Can My Employer Make Me Have the COVID-19 Vaccine (UK)? All adults have now been offered the COVID-19 vaccine . The swift progress of administering vaccines has led to a topical discussion about whether employers can force employees to receive the vaccine. Recent headlines of \u201cno jab no job\u201d and the introduction of specific rules for the care sector have increased this debate. Is It a Legal Requirement for People to Get the COVID-19 Vaccine? With the exception of certain staff working within the health and care sectors (see below) the Government has not legislated for the COVID-19 vaccine to be mandatory for anyone. The Government guidelines on vaccinations say that individuals must be given enough information to enable them to make a decision before they can give consent. By law, the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 gives the Government the power to prevent and control infection. However, the legislation specifically prevents a person from being required to undertake medical treatments such as vaccinations. Accordingly, further primary legislation would need to be introduced in order to legally mandate a COVID-19 vaccination. Whilst employers can certainly encourage their staff to receive the vaccine, vaccinations are voluntary. What Does This Mean for Employees? Employers can certainly encourage their staff to receive the vaccine and ACAS has released guidance on getting the vaccination for work which contains useful guidance. This encourages employers to support staff by discussing the benefits of vaccination. It also offers suggestions for practical support, for example, by offering paid time off to attend vaccination appointments or paying staff their usual rate of pay if they\u2019re off sick with vaccine side effects. However, not every worker will want to be vaccinated and this is a controversial topic that many employers are navigating. The government has identified that this is a \u201ccomplex\u201d topic and there are a variety of reasons as to why an employee may be reluctant to receive the vaccine, which will need to be reviewed on a case by case basis. A key question that is arising is whether it is ethical and legal for employers to request staff to be vaccinated before they return to the workplace, particularly when some will refuse for religious, philosophical or health care reasons. As a starting point, in the absence of vaccination becoming a\nTo prohibit vaccination mandates for COVID\u201319.

This suggests that Spanish is a significant second language among students.\n\n2. **Current Data on Language Use**: According to the latest census and educational statistics, Spanish is indeed one of the most commonly spoken languages in the United States. As of recent data, around 13% to 15% of the total US population speaks Spanish at home. However, among school-aged children, this percentage can vary based on demographics and geographic areas.\n\n3. **Estimation of Spanish Speakers**: While specific numbers can fluctuate, estimates suggest that around 20% of students in certain regions, especially in areas with higher Hispanic populations, may speak Spanish. This is close to the figure of 24% mentioned in the statement.\n\n4. **Conclusion Based on Knowledge**: Given that the claim states \"24 of every 100 kids,\" which translates to 24%, this figure is slightly higher than the commonly referenced estimates of around 20%. However, it is within a reasonable range considering variations in demographics and regional differences across the US.\n\nAfter considering the above points, the statement is not entirely accurate but is close to the truth based on available data.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 0, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.0}

This indicates a public perception of cognitive decline but does not provide concrete evidence of dementia.\n\n2. **Biden's Public Appearances**: The knowledge does not detail specific behaviors or medical evaluations that would confirm a diagnosis of dementia. It does mention Biden's engagement in political activities and his communication with his family, which suggests he is still functioning in his role.\n\n3. **Hunter Biden's Reflections**: Hunter Biden's comments about his father reflect a deep emotional connection and do not indicate any clinical observations of dementia. The focus is more on the personal relationship rather than cognitive health.\n\n4. **Political Context**: The statement is situated within a political context where Biden's age (81) is frequently discussed, and concerns about his mental acuity are used by opponents. However, this does not equate to a clinical diagnosis.\n\nIn summary, while there are public concerns regarding Biden's mental capability, there is no definitive evidence provided in the knowledge to confirm that he is showing severe signs of dementia.

[ 29 ] In August 2013, Biden was admitted to the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and diagnosed with brain cancer, after experiencing what White House officials called \"an episode of disorientation and weakness\". [ 30 ] A lesion was removed at that time. Biden had radiation and chemotherapy treatments and the cancer remained stable. On May 20, 2015, he was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, because of a recurrence of brain cancer. He died there ten days later, on May 30, 2015, at the age of 46. [ 31 ] His funeral was held at St. Anthony of Padua Roman Catholic Church in Wilmington, Delaware , on June 6, 2015. [ 32 ] He was buried at St. Joseph's on the Brandywine in Greenville, Delaware . [ 27 ] Hunter Biden Main article: Hunter Biden See also: Biden\u2013Ukraine conspiracy theory and Hunter Biden laptop controversy Robert Hunter Biden was born on February 4, 1970, in Wilmington, Delaware. Along with his mother and siblings, he was in the 1972 crash, sustaining injuries to his skull. Along with his older brother, he survived after receiving months of medical treatment. Like his father and brother, Hunter attended Archmere Academy in Claymont, Delaware . He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Georgetown University in 1992. During the year after he graduated from college, he served as a Jesuit volunteer at a church in Portland, Oregon , and met Kathleen Buhle , whom he married in 1993. After attending Georgetown University Law Center for one year, he transferred to Yale Law School and graduated in 1996. [ 33 ] He and Kathleen divorced in 2017 and, in 2019, he married Melissa Cohen. After law school, Hunter accepted a position at bank holding company MBNA America, a major contributor to his father's political campaigns. By 1998, Biden had risen to the rank of executive vice president. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] During the 2020 election , the Trump administration pointed out that Hunter Biden had connections with the Ukrainian holding company Burisma . [ 35 ] Beau, Ashley and Hunter Biden as young children, c. 1983 In September 2024, Hunter Biden, pleaded guilty to all nine charges in his federal tax evasion case, surprising prosecutors as they prepared for trial.

Four-year-old Beau Biden, foreground, rests while his father, Joe Biden, center, is sworn in as a U.S. senator from Delaware in a Wilmington hospital, on Jan. 5, 1973. AP file But Beau Biden\u2019s passing only reignited addiction challenges Hunter Biden had faced before. In his 2021 memoir, Hunter said he felt the unresolved trauma both he and his brother dealt with after the accident in 1972 \u201cmanifested themselves differently in each of us,\u201d for the rest of their lives. To blame it for his own substance abuse battles would be a \u201ccop-out,\u201d he wrote, but added later that it took him decades \u201cto acknowledge that original loss, address that original trauma, recognize that original pain.\u201d Reflecting on grief recently in an interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, Joe Biden said that as difficult as losing Beau was for him, it \u201cwas even more profound for Hunter\u201d and his daughter, Ashley. \u201cIt made me a little more fatalistic. It also caused me and Jill enormous pain because he should be the one sitting there talking to you, Beau. He was a better man than I am, and so is Hunter,\u201d Joe Biden said. Hunter, in his book, wrote that he and his father initially \u201cdealt with our grief in ways that often were incongruent with helping each other.\u201d His father immersed himself in his work, as vice president and then in the run-up to his 2020 campaign, but ultimately the attacks on him in that campaign helped bring them together again. \u201cWhenever I apologized to him for bringing so much heat onto his campaign, he responded by saying how sorry he was for putting me on the spot, for bringing so much heat onto me, especially at a time when I was so determined to get well,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest political debate my dad and I had for months: Who should apologize to whom?\u201d The wrecked car of Neilia Biden, 1972.

They say his achievements matter more than his age POLITICS Youth activist groups jointly endorse Biden. They say his achievements matter more than his age Will Weissert Associated Press March 11, 2024, 8:12 a.m. ET View Comments Washington \u2014 Jack Lobel is a college sophomore who will be voting in his first presidential election this fall, casting a ballot for Joe Biden. At 19, he's six-plus decades Biden's junior, which isn't lost on him. But Lobel is spokesperson for Voters of Tomorrow, one of 15 youth organizations that announced Monday that they are jointly endorsing the reelection of the oldest president in U.S. history \u2014 defying polls consistently showing voter concerns about the 81-year-old Biden's age. \u201cIf age were really a concern we would not see this much energy around these groups,\" said Lobel, an urban studies major in New York. As he worked on hammering out the joint endorsement this week he was also writing a paper for his American urban politics class and taking a midterm in his voting and political behavior class. \u201cPresident Biden comes before midterms and exams and papers,\u201d Lobel said, only half-joking. The joint endorsement is meant as a show of political strength for Biden, who would be 86 by the end of the second term he's seeking \u2014 after Super Tuesday all but cemented a November rematch of the 2020 election between him and former President Donald Trump. The groups' affinity for the president is little surprise given that young people tend to be more left-leaning than many other voting blocs. Still, it may soften the blow of many voters' concerns about Biden's age. A recent Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey found that 63% of Americans believe Biden lacks mental capability to serve effectively as president, though 57% felt similar about Trump, who is 77. In the first ad of a $30-million, post-Super-Tuesday, swing-state advertising blitz, Biden makes no excuses for his age, but says he's been more effective as president than Trump was. \u201cYoung voters are critical to President Biden\u2019s winning coalition and together, we will defeat Donald Trump and continue to build a future that works for every single American,\" said Biden's reelection campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, in a statement first shared with The Associated Press. Joining Voters of Tomorrow formally supporting Biden is NextGen PAC, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, Blue\naddiction, and blasted Republicans who he said \u201chave taken the light of my dad\u2019s love for me and presented it as darkness.\u201d Hunter Biden has also said Republicans are weaponizing the president\u2019s love for him to distract him in the campaign. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to kill me knowing it will be a pain greater than my father could be able to handle,\u201d he said in a podcast interview with the recording artist Moby.

Mark Makela / Getty Images file In private conversations, the president has blamed himself for the fact that his son remains such a political target, telling associates it would not be happening if he were not in office and running for another term. Hunter Biden \u201ccomes up all the time,\u201d one source who has spoken with the president said, sometimes out of concern but also with pride at how he has endured the harsh spotlight recently. Not everyone in the West Wing, even at senior levels, knew what Hunter Biden would say Wednesday. But the president, who speaks with his son most days, if not multiple times each day, knew. And sources close to the president quickly praised the remarks as \u201cpowerful\u201d and \u201cforceful.\u201d Republicans have made \u201cwhere\u2019s Hunter\u201d a calling card of the 2024 race, with merchandise bearing the slogan. Biden advisers have noted, though, that Hunter Biden was also a target in the 2020 race and said the president\u2019s critics often miss that the president\u2019s standing by his son, especially supporting him in his recovery, has often made those attacks backfire.

The Memorial Fund announced in its 2018 Preliminary End-of-Year Law Enforcement Fatalities Report that 144 federal, state, local, tribal and territorial officers died in the line of duty over the past year, representing a 12 percent increase over the 129 officers who died in the line of duty in 2017. Firearms-related fatalities claimed the lives of 52 officers in 2018, a 13 percent increase compared to the 46 officers killed in firearms-related incidents in 2017. Of the 52 officer deaths, 14 occurred while officers were attempting to place an individual under arrest. Eight officers were killed while conducting an investigative activity. Six officers were killed responding to domestic disturbance and public disturbance calls, each totaling 12. Five officers were ambushed in 2018, a 50 percent decrease over 2017. Four officers were shot and killed conducting traffic stops. Two officers were killed while serving warrants and two officers were killed while handling or transporting prisoners. Two officers were inadvertently shot by other law enforcement personnel. One officer was killed while responding to a burglary; one was killed during a tactical situation and one was killed while responding to a call for an armed suicidal suspect. Handguns were the leading type of firearm used against law enforcement in 2018. Of the 52 officer fatalities, 31 officers were shot and killed with a handgun; four were disarmed and shot with their own duty weapons. Traffic-related fatalities increased nine percent from 2017 with 50 officer deaths. Of those, 32 officers were killed in crashes. Fourteen officers were struck while outside of their vehicle, a 56 percent increase over the nine officers struck and killed in 2017. Four officers were killed in motorcycle crashes. Of the 32 vehicle crashes, 16 were single-vehicle crashes, a 14 percent increase over the previous year when 14 officers died in single-vehicle crashes. Seven of those single-vehicle crashes involved officers who were responding to a\nnine officers struck and killed in 2017. Four officers were killed in motorcycle crashes. Of the 32 vehicle crashes, 16 were single-vehicle crashes, a 14 percent increase over the previous year when 14 officers died in single-vehicle crashes. Seven of those single-vehicle crashes involved officers who were responding to a call for service or as backup to another officer at the time of the crash. The number of officer deaths from other causes also rose in 2018. Forty-two officers died of causes other than firearms- or traffic-related incidents, a 14 percent increase over the 37 who died in 2017. Job-related illnesses such as heart attacks or strokes were the cause of 18 officer deaths, a 17 percent increase over the 21 who died in 2017. Of those 42 deaths, 15 officers died due to cancers related to search and recovery efforts after the attack on the World Trade Centers on September 11, 2001. Four officers drowned. three were beaten to death and two officers were struck by a train. Texas, Florida, California, and New York had the highest number of officer fatalities with 11 each. North Carolina had seven deaths; South Carolina, Georgia, and Indiana each had five. Two territorial officers and nine federal officers also died in 2018. Fourteen states and the District of Columbia did not lose an officer in 2018. Of the 2018 fallen officers, 134 were male and 10 were female. The average age was 41 years with an average length of 12 years of service. \u201cThe rising number of law enforcement officer deaths in 2018 is disappointing news after a decline in 2017,\u201d declared National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund CEO Craig W. Floyd. \u201cSadly this reminds us that public safety is a dangerous job and can come at a very steep price. We must never take the service and sacrifice of law enforcement officers for granted, and we must remember the families of the fallen who are left behind.\u201d There are currently 21,541 names of officers killed in the line of duty inscribed on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, DC, dating back to the first known death in 1791. The deadliest year on record for law enforcement was 1930 when 307 law enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty. The last time officer fatalities dipped below 100 for a single year was 1944. The statistics released are based on\nBlack people are 2.8x more likely to be killed by police than white people in. Location. the U.S. . Police killings per 1 million people in the U.S., 2013\u20132026.\nremain in place, with weekly COVID-19 hospital admissions per 100,000 and the percentage of COVID-19 associated deaths among all deaths now prioritized as the top two surveillance indicators. Mortality surveillance data on COVID-19 death counts, rates, and trends can be found on the COVID Data Tracker webpage , and in a few other places on the CDC\u2019s voluminous website if one digs around long enough. In the first four months of 2023, the reported COVID-19 death toll was almost 37,000, a number that rivals deaths from drug overdose during the same time period. However, as 2023 continued, COVID-19 mortality declined precipitously from earlier in the year. Through September 9, 2023, the provisional count of all US deaths involving COVID-19 was 48,615 compared to over 200,000 during the same time period in 2022. If current trends continue, the death toll for 2023 should be under 70,000 compared to 246,166 in 2022, 463,267 in 2021, and 385,676 in 2020 . This would ceremoniously knock COVID-19 off the list of top 10 causes of death and lead to further recovery in the unprecedented and relatively higher declines in population life expectancy caused by the pandemic in the United States. 1 Without question, this is extremely good news. Beyond basic counts of death, the mortality picture is also showing positive progress. Sharp declines in COVID-19 mortality rates are observed across gender, racial, and ethnic groups. The highest mortality counts and rates remain among people ages 65 and older. Of the 48,615 COVID-19 deaths in 2023 through September 9 , only 10.2% were in the 45-64 year age group and 2.1% were among people under age 45. The significant decrease in COVID-19 mortality is largely attributed to improved treatments and to widespread immunity from severe disease through both acquired infection and vaccination. While the 2023 COVID-19 mortality scene is full of positive news, there are some red flags that warrant deeper scrutiny. The percent of COVID-19 deaths among all deaths was reported as 2.5% for the week of October 28, 2023 , ranging from 0% to 4.8% across states. However, trend data on this metric\u2014which has been a CDC priority surveillance indicator since May 2023\u2014 are nowhere to be found, which makes it impossible to interpret this key indicator in an absolute or relative sense. In addition, COVID-19 mortality started trending back upwards in August 2023, including in recent weeks when mortality data are still"}], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 5, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.0}

The country\u2019s journey into nationhood was herald by high hopes and prospects for national unity, peace and development. This was because of its vast human and material resources, and land mass. Nigeria is dominantly made of three prominent regions: the North (Hausa Fulani), the West (Yorubas) and the East (Igbos) with minorities in other regions. The military took over the leadership of the country barely six years into her independence as a nation. The military held sway for twenty nine years out of the ininitial forty years of the country\u2019s post independence history before her return to civil rule in 1999. The county is still been confronted with challenges on all fronts ranging from insecurity and insurgency, economy, political uncertainty, electoral malpractices, high rate of unemployment, poor infrastructure amongst others. Literature have been skewed toward military intervention in politics as the root cause of the challenges bedeviling the country more than two decades after her return to civil rule. The study employed both quantitative and qualitative data. The study analysed the history of military rule in Nigeria and interrogated the crux of the military institution. It further analysed the peculiarities of each of the military regimes. The study also examined the post-military era in the country and concluded with recommendations.\nMilitary dictatorship in Nigeria - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Nigerian military reign from 1966\u20131999 Federal Republic of Nigeria (1966; 1966\u20131979; 1983\u20131993; 1993\u20131999) Republic of Nigeria note (1966) 1966\u20131979 1983\u20131993 1993\u20131999 Flag Coat of arms Motto: \"Peace, Unity, Freedom\" [ 1 ] (1966\u20131978) \"Unity and Faith, Peace and Progress\" [ 1 ] (1978\u20131979; 1983\u20131993; 1993\u20131999) Anthem: Nigeria, We Hail Thee [ 1 ] (1966\u20131978) Arise, O Compatriots [ 1 ] (1978\u20131979; 1983\u20131993; 1993\u20131999) Capital Lagos (1966\u20131979; 1983\u20131991) Abuja (1991\u20131993; 1993\u20131999) Largest city Lagos Common languages English Hausa Igbo Yoruba and other regional languages Religion Christianity Islam Traditional beliefs Government Federal presidential republic under military dictatorship (January\u2013May 1966; 1966\u20131979; 1983\u20131993; 1993\u20131999) [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Unitary presidential republic under military dictatorship (24 May 1966 \u2013 31 August 1966) Head of State / President \u2022 1966 Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi b \u2022 1966\u20131975 Yakubu Gowon \u2022 1975\u20131976 Murtala Mohammed \u2022 1976\u20131979 Olusegun Obasanjo \u2022 1983\u20131985 Muhammadu Buhari \u2022 1985\u20131993 Ibrahim Babangida \u2022 1993\u20131998 Sani Abacha \u2022 1998\u20131999 Abdulsalami Abubakar c Chief of Staff / Vice President \u2022 1966 Babafemi Ogundipe (first) \u2022 1998\u20131999 Mike Akhigbe (last) Legislature None ( rule by decree ) Historical era Cold War \u2022 Established 15 January 1966 \u2022 Unification Decree [ 2 ] 24 May 1966 \u2022 1966 Nigerian counter-coup 28 July 1966 \u2022 Federal system restored [ 3 ] 31 August 1966 \u2022 Biafra secession d 30 May 1967 \u2022 1975 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat 29 July 1975 \u2022 1976 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt 13 February 1976 \u2022 Second Republic 1 October 1979 \u2022 1983 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat 31 December 1983 \u2022 1985 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat 27 August 1985 \u2022 1993 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat 17 November 1993 \u2022 Fourth Republic 29 May 1999 Area 1991 [ 4 ] 923,768 km 2 (356,669 sq mi) Population \u2022 1991 [ 4 ] 88,514,501 Currency Nigerian pound (1966\u20131973) Naira (\u20a6) (1973\u20131979; 1983\u20131993; 1993\u20131999) Time zone UTC +1 ( WAT ) ISO 3166 code NG Preceded by Succeeded by First Nigerian Republic Second Nigerian Republic Second Nigerian Republic Third Nigerian Republic Fourth Nigerian Republic Today part of Nigeria Cameroon e ^a Formal name of the country from 24 May to 31 August 1966.

This implies an extremely low population number, which would indicate a severe decline.\n\n2. **Historical Context**: North American bison, also known as buffalo, faced dramatic population declines due to hunting and habitat loss, particularly during the 19th century when colonizers expanded westward across North America. By the late 1800s, bison numbers had plummeted drastically.\n\n3. **Population Numbers**: While it is true that the population of North American bison was reduced to critically low levels, the specific claim of only twenty-seven individuals is exaggerated. Historical records show that by the end of the 19th century, the population had fallen to a few hundred, not just twenty-seven.\n\n4. **Current Status**: As of recent years, conservation efforts have helped to increase the population of bison significantly. Today, there are several hundred thousand bison in North America, including both wild and ranch-raised populations.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The statement is inaccurate because it claims an extremely low number of bison (twenty-seven), which does not reflect the historical record or the current status of bison populations.\n\nBased on this analysis, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 0, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.0}
{"claim": "U.S. President Donald Trump has suspended all travel from China.", "label": "Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking", "result": {"response": "To assess the factual accuracy of the statement \"U.S. President Donald Trump has suspended all travel from China,\" let's analyze the relevant knowledge points provided.\n\n1. The text mentions that on January 31, 2020, Trump announced travel restrictions that suspended entry to nearly all foreign nationals who had been in China within the previous 14 days. This indicates that there were specific restrictions in place regarding travel from China, but it does not explicitly state that all travel was suspended.\n\n2. The knowledge also notes that there were exemptions for certain groups, including citizens and permanent residents of the U.S., as well as some close family members of citizens and permanent residents. This suggests that while there were significant restrictions, they did not constitute a complete suspension of all travel from China.\n\n3. The context provided highlights that the restrictions were part of a broader response to the COVID-19 pandemic, aimed at reducing the spread of the virus.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the statement is misleading. While there were significant travel restrictions imposed by Trump, it was not a complete suspension of all travel from China, as there were exemptions for certain individuals.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "trusted journalism and civil dialogue.

They will then continue to an enhanced entry screening where the passenger will be asked about their medical history, current condition, and asked for contact information for local health authorities. Additionally, some passengers will have their temperature taken. After the enhanced entry screening is complete, passengers will be given written guidance about COVID-19 and be allowed to proceed to their final destination. Once home, individuals must immediately self-quarantine in their home and monitor their health in accordance with CDC best practices. In order to ensure compliance, local and State public health officials will contact individuals in the days and weeks following their arrival.

Biden and the restrictions on China During the meeting with DeSantis, Trump repeated his false claim that Biden had apologized for previous criticism of Trump\u2019s travel restrictions on China. \u201cHe said all sorts of things, we won\u2019t even say it. And then he apologized because \u2013 two weeks ago he put out a statement that I was right,\u201d Trump said . Facts First: Biden\u2019s campaign announced in early April that he supports Trump\u2019s travel restrictions on China, so part of Trump\u2019s claim is correct. But neither Biden nor his campaign apologized for any previous criticism of Trump. The campaign says that the Biden comments Trump has described as criticism of the China restrictions \u2013 in which Biden said Trump has a record of \u201chysterical xenophobia\u201d and \u201cfear mongering\u201d \u2013 were not about the travel restrictions at all. The campaign says Biden did not know about the China restrictions at the time of the January 31 speech in which he made these remarks, since his campaign event in Iowa started shortly after the briefing during which the China restrictions were revealed by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. Given the timing of the Biden remarks, it\u2019s not unreasonable for the Trump campaign to infer that Biden was talking about the travel restrictions. But Biden never took an explicit position on the restrictions until his April declaration of support \u2013 and whether or not you accept his campaign\u2019s argument that the \u201cxenophobia\u201d claim was not about the restrictions, he certainly hasn\u2019t apologized.

It imposes full restrictions and entry limitations on 2 countries that were previously subject to partial restrictions: Laos and Sierra Leone. The Proclamation continues partial restrictions of nationals from 4 of the 7 original high-risk countries: Burundi, Cuba, Togo, and Venezuela. Because Turkmenistan has engaged productively with the United States and demonstrated significant progress since the previous Proclamation, this new Proclamation lifts the ban on its nonimmigrant visas, while maintaining the suspension of entry for Turkmen nationals as immigrants. It adds partial restrictions and entry limitations on 15 additional countries: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Dominica, Gabon, The Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The Proclamation includes exceptions for lawful permanent residents, existing visa holders, certain visa categories like athletes and diplomats, and individuals whose entry serves U.S. national interests. The Proclamation narrows broad family-based immigrant visa carve-outs that carry demonstrated fraud risks, while preserving case-by-case waivers. SECURING OUR BORDERS AND INTERESTS: The restrictions and limitations imposed by the Proclamation are necessary to prevent the entry of foreign nationals about whom the United States lacks sufficient information to assess the risks they pose, garner cooperation from foreign governments, enforce our immigration laws, and advance other important foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism objectives.

A: Source control refers to a person's use of barrier face coverings or face masks, including cloth face coverings, to cover the person's mouth and nose when they are talking, sneezing, or coughing to reduce the likelihood of transmission of infection by preventing the spread of respiratory secretions and large particles. COVID-19 may be spread by individuals who may or may not have symptoms of COVID-19. The general public's use of cloth face coverings made from common, easily accessible materials, are an additional public health approach to help slow the spread of COVID-19. The CDC has information on Types of Masks and Respirators for the general public. Barrier face coverings and face masks, including cloth face coverings, intended for a medical purpose, such as prevention of infectious disease transmission, are subject to FDA regulation. The FDA has issued a policy of regulatory flexibility for such products, as well as an emergency use authorization (EUA) for face masks.

But Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg last week said Conservatives did not need to do so because they knew each other well, and this meant they were complying with government guidance. And he claimed Labour MPs only wore masks when the television cameras were around. The latest official guidance says people in England should cover their faces around \"people you don't normally meet\". It comes as the World Health Organisation (WHO) urged MPs to wear masks during Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget speech, when there is likely to be standing room only in the Commons chamber. Dr David Nabarro, the WHO's special envoy for Covid-19, told Sky News that \"everybody\" should be wearing masks in close confinement with other people, \"including our leaders\". \"This virus, it is absolutely unstoppable, it gets everywhere, and so we have to do everything we possibly can to stop it. \"And one of the best ways to stop it is a well-fitting surgical mask properly over your face, pushed in over your nose, covering everything, and that reduces the risk to others and the risk to you. \"If it works, why on earth don't people use it? It's not a party political issue - this virus doesn't vote.\" Garry Graham, deputy general secretary of the union Prospect, said the public looked to MPs to set an example. \"It's welcome that House authorities are finally catching on to what unions have been saying, that it's too early to relax. But we're still left in the ludicrous situation where MPs do as they please on masks while everyone else does the right thing,\" he said. \"Continuously changing an already inconsistent message is a recipe for non-compliance and increased risk to everyone.\" House of Commons Chancellor's Autumn Statement Personal protective equipment (PPE)"}], "source": "rag_only"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 5, "concluded_by_rag": true, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.0}

The FDA Commissioner may issue an EUA to authorize a medical product for use in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no adequate, approved, or available alternatives when certain criteria for issuance are met. The Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for diagnostic, non-diagnostic, and therapeutic medical devices that the FDA has issued related to COVID-19 may be revised, terminated, or revoked as appropriate. For details on the Emergency Use Authorizations for these devices, see: Personal Protective Equipment EUAs Other Medical Device EUAs Face Mask EUA (PDF - 98KB) If you need help with the EUA process for face masks, surgical masks, or respirators, contact CDRH-NonDiagnosticEUA-Templates@fda.hhs.gov . To identify FDA-cleared surgical masks and respirators, search the 510(k) Premarket Notification database . Q: What is a pre-EUA? A: To help prepare for potential and current emergencies, the FDA works with medical device developers to prepare pre-EUA packages when appropriate. A pre-EUA package contains data and information about the safety, quality, and effectiveness of the product, its intended use, and information about the emergency or potential emergency. The pre-EUA process allows the FDA's scientific and technical subject matter experts to begin a review of information and consideration of the EUA statutory criteria, assist in the development of conditions of authorization, fact sheets, and other documentation that would be needed for an EUA, and also helps to facilitate completion of EUA requests during a current emergency declaration. If you need\na chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear agent; That the known and potential benefits of the product, when used to diagnose, prevent or treat such disease or condition, outweigh the known and potential risks of the product; and That there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives to the product for diagnosing, preventing, or treating such disease or condition. FDA may revise or revoke EUAs at any time, for example, when the drug receives FDA-approval and such product is sufficiently available to meet the public health demand, or when revision or revocation is appropriate to protect the public health or safety. FDA\u2019s EUA page has information about vaccine and therapeutic products currently authorized under an EUA, as well as the current product fact sheets and additional information for health care professionals and patients. FDA and Health and Human Services Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response have announced extensions to the shelf life for some EUA products. Find these updates on FDA\u2019s Expiration Dating Extension page. Learn more about EUAs in this video . Read more about COVID-19 regulatory terminology on the FDA website . Types of Treatments (Approved or under EUA) Antiviral Drugs Antiviral drugs are medicines (pills, liquid, an inhaled powder, or an intravenous solution) that fight against viruses in your body. Immune Modulators Immune modulators are medicines that help activate, boost, or suppress the immune function. In the case of COVID-19 infection, the immune system can become hyperactive which may result in worsening of disease. Immune modulators can help suppress this hyperinflammation. Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs) targeting SARS-COV-2 SARS-COV-2-targeting mAbs are laboratory-produced antibodies that can help the immune system's attack on SARS-COV-2. These mAbs block entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus. SARS-CoV-2 can mutate over time, resulting in genetic variation in the population of circulating viral strains. Some variants can cause resistance to one or more of the mAb therapies authorized to treat COVID-19. Renal Replacement Therapy Solutions Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a type of \u201cdialysis,\u201d which is a machine treatment that filters and purifies the blood when a patient\u2019s kidneys are damaged or are not functioning normally.

The income estimates in the main sections of this report are based on the concept of money income, which is pretax and does not account for the value of in-kind transfers. Appendix A provides a detailed explanation of how income is measured using the CPS ASEC. Estimates of post-tax income and inequality are included in Appendix B. Income in the United States: 2023 [<1.0 MB] Highlights Real median household income was $80,610 in 2023, a 4.0 percent increase from the 2022 estimate of $77,540 (Figure 1 and Table A-1). This is the first statistically significant annual increase in real median household income since 2019. Real median household incomes increased by 5.4 percent for White households and by 5.7 percent for non-Hispanic White households between 2022 and 2023. There was no significant change in median incomes for Black, Asian, and Hispanic households (Figure 2 and Table A-1). Household income rose throughout the income distribution, increasing 6.7 percent at the 10th percentile and 4.6 percent at the 90th percentile (Table A-3). Income inequality as measured by the Gini index and income percentile ratios was not significantly different between 2022 and 2023 (Figure 3 and Table A-3). Between 2022 and 2023, the number of total workers increased by 2.2 million, or 1.3 percent. The change in the number of full-time, year-round workers was not statistically significant (Figure 5 and Table A-6). Real median earnings for men who worked full-time, year-round increased by 3.0 percent, and real median earnings increased 1.5 percent for women who worked full-time, year-round (Figure 4 and Table A-6). For full-time, year-round workers, the female-to-male earnings ratio in 2023 fell to 82.7 percent from 84.0 percent in 2022 (Figure 6 and Table A-6).

Here are a few lessons the average person can take away from it. Henglein and Steets / Getty Images Building Wealth Takes Time First, consider how long it took for Biden to become a millionaire. He began his career in 1968 and likely didn\u2019t reach millionaire status for two decades. It\u2019s a good reminder that building a fortune takes time. Instead of trying to get rich quickly, you\u2019re often better off taking the methodical route. Practically, that means consistently spending less than you earn and allocating savings to smart investments. The most realistic path to wealth for the majority of people is investing in the S&P 500, according to financial experts like Warren Buffet and Mark Cuban . It returns an average of around 10.26% . That can add up to quite a bit throughout your life. For example, say you invest $20,000 into the S&P today. Then, you continue investing $1,000 monthly for the next 30 years. You\u2019d end up with over $2.5 million from just $360,000 in contributions. This shows how time creates wealth when you invest well. SrdjanPav / iStock.com The Power of Resiliency Biden\u2019s story is also a good lesson in the power of resiliency. He\u2019s experienced some of the highest highs that a person can because he never gave up during his lowest lows. For example, Biden lost his wife and daughter just after winning his first Senate election.

But three kinds of evidence point to more than 350,000 deaths* By Christie Aschwanden edited by Josh Fischman Peter Horvath * Editor's Note (1/3/21): The number of COVID deaths in the U.S. is now more than 350,000, as of the beginning of January, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center . A persistent falsehood has been circulating on social media: the number of COVID deaths is much lower than official statistics, and therefore the danger of the disease has been overblown. In August, President Donald Trump retweeted a post claiming that only 6 percent of these reported deaths were actually from COVID-19. (The tweet originated from a follower of the debunked conspiracy fantasy QAnon.) Twitter removed the post for containing false information, but fabrications such as these continue to spread. In September outgoing U.S. Representative Roger Marshall of Kansas\u2014now incoming senator\u2014 complained that Facebook had removed a post in which he claimed that 94 percent of COVID-19 deaths reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u201cwere the result of 2-3 additional serious illnesses and were of advanced age.\u201d Now some facts: Researchers know beyond a doubt that the number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. surpassed a quarter of a million people by November 2020. This number is supported by three lines of evidence, including death certificates. The inaccurate idea that only 6 percent of the deaths were really caused by the coronavirus is \u201ca gross misinterpretation\u201d of how death certificates work, says Robert Anderson, chief mortality statistician at the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.

How it Works The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) uses incoming data\ncollected by the Department of Health and Human Services. The number of virus-positive Americans -- 4,100 -- currently entering the hospital each day is down by 6.8% in the last week. Overall, the total remains significantly lower than at the nation's peak this past January, when there were more than 160,000 patients hospitalized with the virus.

COVID-19 has killed over 5 million people worldwide in just 2 years. But how do flu and COVID-19 deaths compare in the United States? On average in the United States, as shown in the graph below, people are less like to die from the flu than COVID-19. In this graph , you can see the difference in flu and COVID-19 mortality rates from 2014 to December 2021: COVID-19 Prevention is Also Flu Prevention It\u2019s important to note that when COVID-19 started spreading and the country went on lockdown in March 2020, the same measures that were used to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d stopped the flu entirely. In fact, the CDC stopped tracking flu activity early for the 2019-2020 season because COVID-19 precautions wiped out the flu. The flu was virtually nonexistent for the 2020-2021 season likely because people were wearing masks, staying home more often, and not socializing. Now that flu and COVID-19 are spreading at the same time, flu deaths may sadly rise again. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to get vaccinated, get tested, and wear masks to prevent both viruses. Flu is Still Serious Just because flu mortality is lower than COVID-19 mortality doesn\u2019t mean flu isn\u2019t serious. CDC estimates that flu has resulted in 9 million \u2013 41 million illnesses, 140,000 \u2013 710,000 hospitalizations, and 12,000 \u2013 52,000 deaths annually between 2010 and 2020.

Altogether, President Biden is proposing raising revenue by more than $4 trillion primarily from new taxes on U.S. businesses and individuals, exceeding the magnitude of his proposed tax hikes during the 2020 campaign ($3.7 trillion on a gross basis). The gross tax increase would be reduced on a net basis by increases in tax credit s for certain individuals and economic activities.

The budget proposes several new tax increases on high-income individuals and businesses, which combined with the\ncapital gains and dividends. However, all of these tax increases would be limited to households making over $400,000, which is only around 1.5 percent of total households. Biden proposes another $1.8 trillion of taxes on corporations, under our central estimate . Most economists and estimators believe corporate tax burdens are borne by some combination of shareholders, owners of capital, and workers. Since many middle-class households include both workers and shareholders (through pensions and retirement accounts, for example), any increase in corporate taxes would indirectly increase their tax burden, albeit modestly. Based on analyses and estimates of Biden's tax plan published by the Tax Policy Center , Penn Wharton Budget Model , Tax Foundation , and American Enterprise Institute , tax burdens among the bottom 80 percent of households in the income distribution would see a 0.2 to 0.6 percent reduction in after-tax income. For a typical family in the middle of the income distribution, this amounts to $180 to $260 per year. But again, these are indirect tax increases. And they don't include many of the tax cuts proposed by Vice President Biden, which will more than offset the increase for many households. It is important to note that Biden's plans, as we've estimated in The Cost of the Trump and Biden Campaign Plans , fall $5.6 trillion short of being offset. Covering this cost may in fact require new taxes on a broader swath of Americans. But as of now, only a small share of Americans would face a tax increase under Biden's plans. Ruling: Largely False Claim #2: Joe Biden would have the largest tax increase in history. In a tweet on Saturday afternoon and again Wednesday morning , President Trump claimed that Vice President Biden's proposed tax increases would be the largest in history. SLEEPY JOE BIDEN IS PROPOSING THE BIGGEST TAX HIKE IN OUR COUNTRY\u2019S HISTORY! CAN ANYBODY REALLY VOTE FOR THIS? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2020 Biden's proposed tax increases, if enacted all at once, would constitute the first or second largest tax increase since World War II, but not literally the largest in all of history. We rank this as almost true . The President may have been referring to Biden's $4 trillion tax increase (as some PAC-funded campaign ads suggest ) as a record in nominal dollars. If interpreted that way, the President's statement is technically true but also largely\nin revenues from The Apprentice US series, as well as from branding deals where organisations paid to use his name. He also made $176.5m in profit by investing in two office buildings, it is alleged. However, the Times alleges that the president paid almost no taxes on these sizeable earnings, because he reported that the businesses that he owns and runs made significant losses. The Times also alleges that Mr Trump reduced his taxable income by paying consulting fees to Ivanka Trump, his daughter and senior adviser. In financial disclosures filed in 2017, she reported receiving $747,622 from a consulting company she co-owned. Consulting fees of exactly the same amount were claimed as tax deductions by the Trump Organization for hotel projects, the Times says. Mr Trump is also said to have written off more than $70,000 in hair-styling costs as business expenses during his time on The Apprentice. Getty Images President Trump's golf courses in Scotland, together with one in Ireland, made $63.3m in losses in 2018, the New York Times alleges The newspaper also claims that President Trump has been making use of a tax code that enables business owners to \"carry forward leftover losses to reduce taxes in future years\". For example, the newspaper says that President Trump's largest golf resort, Trump National Doral, near Miami, has made $162.3m in losses since he bought it in 2012. Similarly, his two golf courses in Scotland and one in Ireland have reported a combined $63.6m in losses, it is alleged. Tax lawyer and policy analyst Steve Rosenthal, who has previously worked with the Times looking into Mr Trump's finances, said the story \"goes to the heart of Trump's image as a successful businessman\". \"You cannot generate the level of losses Trump has generated without failing spectacularly. How he continues to generate losses and continues to operate suggests he is continuing to borrow money to keep operations afloat,\" he told the BBC World Service. But how much, if any, damage this will do to the president is up for debate, says the BBC's North America editor Jon Sopel. This time four years ago, when Hilary Clinton upbraided him over how little tax he paid, Mr Trump replied: \"That makes me smart.\" A lot of his supporters applauded, our editor points out. What has the reaction been? Mr Trump's political opponents condemned his reported tax arrangements.

Taking away step-up in basis has already been tried and failed. In 1976 congress eliminated stepped-up basis but it was so complicated and unworkable it was restored in 1980. As noted in a July 3, 1979 New York Times article , it was \u201cimpossibly unworkable\u201d: \u201cAlmost immediately, however, the new law touched off a flood of complaints as unfair and impossibly unworkable.

Impose a 20 percent minimum tax on \u201cbillionaires\u201d: $360.8 billion tax increase This tax, called a \u201cbillionaire minimum income tax,\u201d would impose an annual 20 percent tax on taxpayers with income and assets that exceeding $100 million, a $360 billion tax increase. This tax is just the latest attempt by the Democrats to reshape the tax code and pass a tax on unrealized gains. This new tax is similar to the wealth taxes pushed by radical progressives such as Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). It would create a \u201cmark to market\u201d regime that would force Americans to pay taxes every year on the paper gain in the value of assets (i.e. stocks, collectibles, real estate). Currently, taxpayers only pay the capital gains tax when an asset is sold. This makes sense because the asset is illiquid until it is disposed of. This tax on unrealized gains would create a new tax system that requires taxpayers to pay tax on the value of an asset based on the value of these assets on a particular arbitrary date. It would empower the IRS, encourage taxpayers to move assets overseas, and could grow to hit millions of Americans over time. It would also harm the economy, impose retroactive taxation, and has failed everywhere it has been tried before. 5.

Show More Influenza outlook CDC expects that the severity of the 2025-2026 influenza season will most likely be classified as moderate across all ages, with low confidence , based on historical trends, expert opinion, and recent surveillance data trends. Our confidence in this assessment is low, downgraded from moderate confidence in our initial influenza outlook, due to uncertainties in the potential impact of circulating influenza viruses on U.S. population immunity and vaccine effectiveness. As of December 16, epidemic trend estimates indicate that influenza infections are growing or likely growing in 47 states and the timing of this increase in activity is similar to several past seasons. Influenza seasons vary widely in number of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths, depending on the subtypes circulating, population immunity, and vaccine effectiveness against circulating influenza viruses. A new influenza A(H3N2) virus subclade recently renamed \"subclade K\" is the predominant virus among influenza A(H3N2) viruses that have been genetically characterized to date this fall in the United States and other countries, including the UK and Canada . CDC first identified Subclade K in the United States in August 2025, and as of December 19, approximately 90% of influenza A(H3N2) viruses that CDC has genetically characterized from U.S. samples collected since September 28 were identified as subclade K. Influenza viruses in this subclade have differences from other circulating influenza viruses including the virus selected as the A(H3N2) component of the U.S. 2025-26 seasonal influenza vaccines. In our initial outlook, we assessed that a more severe 2025-2026 influenza season could occur if an influenza subtype with more severe outcomes, either through higher clinical severity or higher numbers of infections, predominates. The emergence of subclade K could lead to a more severe 2025-2026 influenza season. However, the impact of the emergence of subclade K on the timing and severity of the 2025-2026 influenza season is unclear. Individual and population-level immunity to subclade K influenza viruses might be low and annual influenza vaccine effectiveness might be reduced. In addition, seasons that are H3N2 predominant (the same virus type as subclade K) have been associated with more influenza-associated hospitalizations and deaths in people 65 years and older and in young children compared to other age groups.\n[note 4] Note 4: the highlighted line corresponds to the age group in the subplot title, grey lines correspond to all other age groups.

A small proportion of primary care samples are also included in this reporting. In week 42, data is based on reporting from 9 out of the 14 sentinel laboratories. In week 42, 4,656 respiratory specimens reported through the Respiratory DataMart System were tested for influenza. There were 324 positive samples for influenza: 118 influenza A (not subtyped), 172 influenza A (H3N2), 30 influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, and 9 influenza B.

Lowest activity for influenza: identified as weeks in a given year when, for at least two consecutive weeks, <2% of tests for influenza in those weeks are positive. Week 27 through Week 26 of the following calendar year was used to define a surveillance year in order to capture summer COVID-19 activity as the start of a given season. Lowest activity weeks for ARI were identified as weeks when COVID-19, influenza, and RSV were all identified as having low activity according to their separate thresholds. For each state within a region, the reference periods were used to calculate the values that created the levels (categories) for the 2025-2026 surveillance year. First, we calculated the weekly percentage of ED visits attributed to each pathogen and ARI overall within the identified lowest activity periods. Next, we calculated the mean, M, and standard deviation, S, attributed to each pathogen and ARI overall within the identified lowest activity periods. The mean was considered the baseline value for each state and was used as the top value for the Very Low category. Then, we computed the maximum number of standard deviations above the mean for any observed week over all weeks in the three previous seasons (N = maximum number of standard deviations = ( - M) / S). The maximum number of standard deviations (N) was divided by 4 and multiplied by the standard deviation (S = standard deviation). This value was denoted as D, so D = (N / 4) * S. Using X = percent of ED visits in a week for each pathogen and ARI overall, we classified activity levels as follows: Very Low: X <= M, activity at or below baseline Low: M < X <= M + D Moderate: M + D < X <= M + 2D High: M + 2D < X <= + 3D Very High: M + 3D < X Missouri: Due to data quality issues, Missouri's historical data before MMWR Week 10 of 2025 (March 2-8, 2025) could not be used for computing levels, thus leaving insufficient data.

There is an ongoing discussion about the transition to renewable energy and the implications of such a transition.\n\n2. **Coal and Gas Usage**: The knowledge mentions that coal consumption declined by 3% from 2018 to 2020, while coal-powered electricity generation increased by 51.6% in the same period due to lower hydroelectric generation and gas outages. This suggests that while coal use may have increased for electricity generation, overall coal consumption has decreased.\n\n3. **Impact of Policies**: The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment noted that the increase in coal-powered generation was not a direct result of the oil and gas exploration ban but rather due to lower hydroelectric generation and gas supply issues. This indicates that transitioning away from fossil fuels may face challenges but is not solely responsible for rising prices.\n\n4. **Future Outlook**: It is suggested that coal is unlikely to play a significant role in New Zealand's electricity sector in the long term due to emissions trading schemes and the phasing out of coal by major generators.

As the quarterly figures fluctuate a lot, AAP FactCheck also looked at annual figures. Figures for the year to June 2020 show coal consumption declined by three per cent between 2018 and 2020, from 1,157,243 tonnes to 1,153,579 tonnes. MBIE also reports quarterly on the make-up of New Zealand's electricity generation (table 1). Figures for the year to June show coal-powered electricity generation increased by 51.6 per cent between 2018 and 2020, from 1261GWh to 1912GWh. The figures also show gas-powered electricity generation declined by 10.3 per cent, from 6,354GWh in 2018 to 5,701GWh in 2020. However, MBIE's annual report on the energy sector said the increase in coal-powered generation was due to lower hydro electricity generation as the result of a dry year and maintenance at NZ's largest gas field, which reduced the supply of gas (page 14). \"Electricity generation from coal increased by 43 per cent in 2019,\" the report said. \"This was due to the need for non-renewable generation as a result of less favourable hydrological conditions, and gas outages meaning that there was less gas available for electricity generation use.\" (page 14) The report does not mention that the oil and gas exploration ban has had an impact on the supply of gas. It shows gas production is expected to increase in the near future before steadily declining (page 43, Fig E.7). The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment (PCE) investigated the impact of the government's oil and gas exploration ban and noted that the recent increase in coal-powered generation was \"not because of the ban\" (page 40). It found that, in future, a reduction in gas supply for electricity generation could result in more coal being used as it is currently the cheapest substitute (page 40). But it said \"coal is unlikely to play a role in New Zealand's electricity sector for much longer\" due to the Emissions Trading Scheme and coal being phased out by major generators (page 41). It found New Zealand's remaining gas reserves would probably be sufficient for intermittent electricity generation when hydro dams are low \"for several decades to come, albeit at a higher cost than at present\" (page 39).

Image by AP AAP FactCheck Investigation: Is New Zealand using more coal because of the government's offshore oil and gas exploration ban? The Statement \"The oil and gas exploration ban, what did that do, actually, our coal use has now gone up so now we've got more coal being used instead of natural gas to actually create electricity.\" Judith Collins, National Party leader, September 30, 2020. The Analysis National Party leader Judith Collins says the government's efforts to combat climate change have backfired and New Zealand is using more coal as a result of its offshore oil and gas exploration ban. In April 2018, the Labour-led government announced it would not issue any new permits for offshore oil and gas exploration . The policy became law in February 2019 . During the Newshub Leaders' Debate on September 30, Ms Collins said the policy had resulted in an increase in carbon emissions . (Video mark 1hr, 8min, 30secs). \"The oil and gas exploration ban, what did that do, actually our coal use has now gone up so now we've got more coal being used instead of natural gas to actually create electricity,\" Ms Collins said. AAP FactCheck examined Ms Collins statement that coal use had gone up and more coal is being used to generate electricity instead of gas, as a result of the government's offshore oil and gas exploration ban. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) publishes figures on coal consumption , which do not show an increase in coal consumption after the ban became law. Quarterly MBIE figures show coal consumption declined by 27 per cent between the December 2018 quarter - before the oil and gas exploration ban came into effect - and the June 2020 quarter (table 1). As the quarterly figures fluctuate a lot, AAP FactCheck also looked at annual figures. Figures for the year to June 2020 show coal consumption declined by three per cent between 2018 and 2020, from 1,157,243 tonnes to 1,153,579 tonnes.

However, he does not oppose the concept of school choice as it relates to public schools, which includes allowing students to choose between traditional public schools, magnet schools, and high-performing charter schools.\n\n2. **Definition of School Choice**: The term \"school choice\" can vary in definition. Some people view it as the ability to choose between different types of schools, including public and charter schools, which Biden supports. Others define it as the ability to use public funds for private school tuition, which Biden opposes.\n\n3. **Misrepresentation by Trump**: The knowledge points indicate that President Trump has misrepresented Biden's position by claiming that he wants to \"end school choice\" and \"abolish all charter schools.\" In reality, Biden's stance is nuanced and does not align with Trump's sweeping claims.\n\n4. **Biden's Support for Public School Options**: Biden supports measures that allow parents to choose among public schools, which contradicts the assertion that he wants to end school choice altogether.\n\nGiven this analysis, the statement \"Joe Biden wants to end school choice\" is misleading.

And while Biden opposes vouchers for private school tuition \u2014 the ultimate in school choice for some \u2014 he does not oppose students choosing between public schools, magnet schools and high-performing charter schools. Trump\u2019s attack on Biden was gleaned from policy recommendations drafted by Biden and his former rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders. The 110-page document, called the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force Recommendations, was released July 8 and is not the official Democratic Party platform. Nevertheless, Trump has seized on the document to make a number of misleading claims about Biden\u2019s positions, some of which we have written about previously. In three recent tele-rallies, Trump repeatedly cited the document and misrepresented it: \u201cI saw this two days ago for the first time. He wants to end school choice, no school choice, and abolish charter schools.\u201d \u2013 Trump at a tele-rally in Wisconsin, July 17. \u201cThey want to abolish school choice, end school choice, abolish all charter schools.\u201d \u2013 Trump at a tele-rally in Michigan, July 18 . \u201cI can\u2019t even believe they\u2019re serious, but they seem to be. End school choice and they want to abolish charter schools. Well, people want choice and they want \u2014 they want charter schools.\u201d \u2013 Trump at a tele-rally in North Carolina, July 19 . Charter Schools Here\u2019s what the unity task force recommendations say about charter schools: Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force Recommendations, July 8: Charter schools were originally intended to be publicly funded schools with increased flexibility in program design and operations. Democrats believe that education is a public good a nd should not be saddled with a private profit motive, which is why we wi ll ban for \u2013 profit private charter businesses from receiving federal funding. And we recognize the need for more stringent guardrails to ensure charter schools are good stewards of fed eral education funds. We support measures\nwere doing no better academically but also no worse than otherwise similar peers not given the same opportunity.\u201d In 2019, Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos proposed \u201c Education Freedom Scholarships ,\u201d which would provide $5 billion in annual federal tax credits for businesses and individuals who donate to scholarship organizations that support private school education. That plan has been opposed by many Democrats \u2014 some view it as yet another attempt at vouchers for private schools \u2014 and it has not advanced in Congress . So when Trump says Biden opposes school choice, it\u2019s true that he opposes vouchers for private schools. But not everyone defines school choice that way. According to a Biden campaign official, \u201cJoe Biden opposes the Trump/Devos conception of \u2018school choice,\u2019 which is private school vouchers that would destroy our public schools. He\u2019s also against for-profit and low-performing charter schools, and believes in holding all charter schools accountable. He does not oppose districts letting parents choose to send their children to public magnet schools, high-performing public charters , or traditional public schools.\u201d Magnet schools are part of the local public school system, and function under the same administration (unlike charters). They typically have a curricular focus \u2014 like STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) \u2014 and students from across the school system with an interest in that curricular focus can attend. In short, whether Biden opposes school choice depends on one\u2019s definition of school choice. Some consider offering choices between traditional public schools, magnet schools and charter schools to be \u201cchoice\u201d \u2014 which Biden supports. Others define choice as federal support for private school tuition \u2014 which Biden opposes. The Department of Education, in a 2019 report on school choice , defines \u201cschool choice\u201d as \u201can array of elementary and secondary education options\u201d that includes traditional public schools \u201cwithin or across districts,\u201d public charter schools, private schools and homeschooling.

Charter schools are doing great.\u201d \u2014 President Donald Trump, remarks in the Rose Garden, July 14, 2020 \u201cAbolish school choice, end school choice, abolish \u2014 they want to abolish all school choice, end it. They want to abolish charter schools. This is just never-ending.\u201d \u2014 Trump, remarks during an Arizona telerally, July 18, 2020 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 As president, Bill Clinton was considered a powerful advocate for promoting charter schools, even winning the first-ever lifetime achievement award from the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools. Now, President Donald Trump is charging that former vice president Joe Biden (and his fellow Democrats) has gone so far left that he wants to \u201cabolish all charter schools.\u201d These are publicly funded schools but operated under contract by independent groups, allowing for more flexibility in curriculum and hiring. Is there much basis for Trump\u2019s claim? Let\u2019s examine what Biden stands for \u2014 as well as his position on \u201cschool choice,\u201d which Trump also claims he wants to abolish. Trump claims he\u2019s citing a portion of the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force Recommendations, designed to bridge policy gaps between Biden, who has a record as a centrist, and his last rival for the Democratic nomination, the left-leaning Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. The section on charter schools was eventually added to the draft Democratic Party platform for 2020: \u201cCharter schools were originally intended to be publicly funded schools with increased flexibility in program design and operations. Democrats believe that education is a public good and should not be saddled with a private profit motive, which is why we will ban for-profit private charter businesses from receiving federal funding. And we recognize the need for more stringent guardrails to ensure charter schools are good stewards of federal education funds. We support measures to increase accountability for charter schools, including by requiring all charter schools to meet the same standards of transparency as traditional public schools, including with regard to civil rights protections, racial equity, admissions practices, disciplinary procedures, and school finances. We will call for conditioning federal funding for new, expanded charter schools or for charter school renewals on a district\u2019s review of whether the charter will systematically underserve the neediest students. And Democrats oppose\nof Public Policy at Georgetown University. \u201cHe opposes spending public money to send students to private schools (vouchers/tuition tax credits/opportunity scholarships). He is opposed to for-profit charter schools and \u2018low-performing\u2019 charter schools. But he\u2019s not opposed to charter schools per se. And he\u2019s not opposed to providing students choices within public school systems via magnet schools \u2026 So Trump\u2019s blanket claims are false.\u201d Advertising The Trump campaign stood by Trump\u2019s statements. \u201cInstead of giving parents the opportunity to send their children to a better school, Joe Biden wants to end school choice as we know it,\u201d Trump campaign spokesman Zach Parkinson said. \u201cBiden not only attended a private school himself, he also sent his own children to one, exercising a choice he would deny other parents. From pledging to \u2018end\u2019 charter schools to saying they won\u2019t receive \u2018a penny of federal money\u2019 if he is elected, Biden has made his hostility to school choice abundantly clear. Biden has turned his back on these parents and children, and if elected, would put charter schools on a path to destruction.\u201d A case could be made that Biden has signed onto concepts that could slow the expansion of charter schools \u2014 or that Biden is opposed to providing federal funding for \u201csome\u201d charter schools (the for-profit ones). The distinctions are subtle and certainly open to debate. But instead, Trump tries to create a cartoon version of Biden\u2019s position, sweepingly declaring that Biden wants to \u201cabolish all charter schools.\u201d That\u2019s simply wrong, given how charter schools are run at the local level.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the far-left flank of his party. Speaking in Wilmington, Del., Biden promised a \u201cclean energy revolution,\u201d which he said would deliver millions of jobs, as he attacked President Trump for calling climate change a \u201choax.\u201d Biden detailed what he called a pro-union platform that would replace the US government\u2019s car fleet with American-made electric vehicles and includes a pledge to create a \u201ccarbon pollution-free electric sector by the year 2025.\u201d \u201cThere is no more consequential challenge that we must meet in the next decade than the onrushing climate crisis. Left unchecked, it is literally an existential threat to the health of our planet and to our very survival,\u201d said Biden, 77. Biden\u2019s announcement comes as the presidential wannabe courts idols on the left of his party including Bronx-Queens Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the hope that they will support him and steer young voters his way in November. In May, AOC announced she had been selected to co-chair Biden\u2019s climate change panel along with former Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. Photo by OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images The former veep on Tuesday promised to \u201ccreate millions of high-paying union jobs by building a modern infrastructure and a clean energy future\u201d and described his vision of a US covered in 500,000 electric car charging stations and thriving factories producing green products. \u201cWhen Donald Trump thinks about renewable energy, he sees windmills somehow causing cancer . When I think about these windmills, I see American manufacturing, American workers rising to dominate the global markets,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI see steel that will be needed for those windmill platforms, towers and ladders which could be made in small manufacturers,\u201d he said. \u201cI see the union-certified men and women who will manufacture and install.\u201d \u201cI see the ports that will come back to life and the longshoremen and the shipbuilders and the communities they support,\u201d he continued. The Green New Deal introduced by AOC \u2014 which even Democrats trashed \u2014 unanimously failed in a Senate vote last year. In a statement to Reuters after news broke that AOC was joining Biden\u2019s climate change panel, a spokesperson for the Democratic socialist\nbroadly align with an approach advocated by the left-wing of the Democratic party. Firstly, like the Green New Deal, Biden\u2019s plans reframe climate action as a jobs, infrastructure and clean energy stimulus . After three decades of economic elites failing to pitch a carbon tax as a solution to the supposed \u201cmarket failure\u201d of greenhouse gas emissions, Biden has elected to focus instead on economy-wide performance standards as the cutting edge of decarbonization. And while earlier generations of Democrats wanted consumers to foot the bill for that clean energy transition at the gas pump, a position shared by Milton Friedman , Biden takes Keynes and Franklin Roosevelt as his intellectual and political forebears. Perhaps most encouragingly, Biden views the workers, unions and communities of color most impacted by the fossil fuel economy and the potential shift away from it as deserving special attention. In his view, climate action cannot be separated from economic, environmental and social justice. This is, in the broadest strokes, the climate policy gospel according to many progressives. Biden\u2019s plans draw upon the Green New Deal-inflected recommendations issued by the joint taskforce convened by surrogates of the Biden and Bernie Sanders campaigns, including Ocasio-Cortez. They also crib heavily from plans devised by Washington governor Jay Inslee\u2019s climate-focused presidential campaign and are delightfully similar to policies drafted by Data for Progress , an upstart leftwing thinktank where I work. (Full disclosure: we provided research and recommendations to the joint taskforce and campaign.) Now, Biden would be wise to run on these ideas and staff up his administration to make them happen. Over recent months, public opinion research from Data for Progress has shown that climate change is a uniquely favorable general election issue for Biden and Democrats. When it comes to climate and clean energy priorities, voters trust the Democratic party more than the Republican party by an 18% margin . Climate change is a strong mobilization issue for the young voters Biden has struggled to attract to his campaign. In a May survey , 61% of voters under 45 said they would be more likely to vote for Biden if he committed to a platform that would move the United States to a 100% clean energy economy, with just 14% reporting that such a platform would make them less likely to support the Democratic nominee. A more recent survey fielded in late June by Climate Power, the\nNew Deal's timeline is more aggressive, calling for a 10-year national mobilization to generate \"100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources.\" Both the Green New Deal and Biden's plan call for overhauling the American transportation industry to reduce pollution and greenhouse gases by creating more public transit and pushing the country toward more hybrid and electric cars. Biden's plan puts forth proposals like giving Americans rebates to trade in gas-guzzling vehicles for more efficient American cars, incentivizing auto companies to offer more zero-emission vehicles, and investing in 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, among other ideas. Biden calls Trump a \"climate arsonist\" amid historic wildfires 02:33 One area where Biden's position has differed more significantly from environmental activists \u2014 and many of his rivals in the Democratic presidential primaries \u2014 has been on fracking. Fracking, short for hydraulic fracturing, is a drilling method for extracting natural gas from shale formations underground by injecting liquid at high pressure. Since 2005, the use of fracking in the U.S. has grown exponentially . Some energy experts forecast the U.S. will be the world's top exporter of natural gas within the next few years. While the Green New Deal does not explicitly mention anything about fracking, its timeline to cut emissions from the power sector is so rapid that eliminating fracking is implied in the proposal. Banning fracking has certainly been a priority among climate activists. However, fracking is a substantial source of jobs and revenue in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania, where some 32,000 workers are employed in the fracking and natural gas industry. Biden told voters there in July that fracking \"is not on the chopping block,\" though his campaign says he supports no new fracking on federal land. \"It is not surprising that Biden said he doesn't support a Green New Deal. He has a climate plan that's in line with science \u2014 but he has never vocally supported a GND,\" says Emily Atkin, a popular climate journalist who writes and hosts HEATED , a newsletter and podcast followed closely by many progressive climate crusaders. \"This is completely in line with who he said he was. Also, he's trying to win Pennsylvania.\" (According to the latest CBS News Battleground Tracker poll , Biden currently leads President Trump in the state by 5 points.) Though he's faced some criticism over fracking from\nfor Biden if he committed to a platform that would move the United States to a 100% clean energy economy, with just 14% reporting that such a platform would make them less likely to support the Democratic nominee. A more recent survey fielded in late June by Climate Power, the Global Strategies Group and Data for Progress found that bold climate action was also persuasive for middle-of-the-road and Latino voters. Even after survey respondents were shown strong messaging attacks from Trump and Republicans claiming that Democrats wanted to pass a $100tn Green New Deal that would increase taxes \u2013 as well as more outlandish arguments that Democrats were going to take away hamburgers, pickup trucks and airplanes \u2013 voters moved even further in Democrats\u2019 direction. Middle partisans shifted two percentage points further in favor of Biden, while Latinos leaned a further four points towards him. These findings show that one of Trump and Republicans\u2019 favorite act: that \u201cVenezuela-style socialists are going to take away the American way of life\u201d \u2013 doesn\u2019t work. In fact, an analysis of the 2019 Cooperative Congressional Election Study published by Data for Progress found that 2016 Trump voters who are unsure how they will vote in 2020 are uniquely cross-pressured on climate issues. They view climate change as being much more important than other 2016 Trump voters and side with Biden and Democrats on key policy issues, like the Paris Climate Agreement and Clean Power Plan. Crucially, they also tend to be young, meaning that if Democrats can attract these voters in 2020, they could grow their base for years to come. As Biden prepares for election day in November, he would be wise to run on his Green New Deal-style climate plan. And if he wins \u2013 which polls suggest he will \u2013 he\u2019s going to need to staff up to turn these campaign promises into laws. Here, activists still have a lot of leverage. The most recent polling from Data for Progress shows that 44% of voters would be more likely to support a candidate who doesn\u2019t take money from fossil fuel companies, executives and lobbyists and that 49% would be opposed to industry representatives receiving appointments to government agencies and the White House. These are strange and scary times. The pandemic has laid bare some of the most devastating and brutal flaws of our corrupt president and our nakedly capitalist society. The\nattempting to tackle other related issues such as environmental justice, sustainable housing, supporting a \"just transition\" for workers whose jobs are affected, and the building of major infrastructure projects such as high speed rail, which is mentioned in both proposals. Green jobs and infrastructure At their core, both the Green New Deal and Biden's climate plan are about jobs as well as the environment. They both place an emphasis on supporting labor unions' right to organize and bargain for fair wages for their members. The Green New Deal sets a goal of providing a guaranteed job with a family-sustaining wage and benefits to every American \u2014 but Biden does not go that far. Biden's jobs plan is big, but not as comprehensive as the Green New Deal's. He pledges to create millions of new jobs by retooling the auto industry for low-emission vehicles, building infrastructure for a green future, upgrading millions of buildings to be more energy efficient, constructing 1.5 million new sustainable housing units, and cleaning up pollution from oil and gas wells and coal mining sites. \"When Donald Trump thinks about climate change, he thinks 'hoax.' I think 'jobs',\" Biden has said . He aims to provide additional jobs out of the pandemic by boosting this green energy economy. Climate change is also expected to continually increase major stresses on America's already aging infrastructure. To address this, both plans call for major investments to, as the Green New Deal puts it, \"meet the challenges of the 21st century.\" Biden's plan calls for making \"smart infrastructure investments to rebuild the nation and to ensure that our buildings, water, transportation, and energy infrastructure can withstand the impacts of climate change.\" However, on housing, Biden's proposal to build 1.5 million new sustainable housing units is far short of the lofty ambitions of the Green New Deal, which calls for \"providing all people of the United States with affordable, safe, and adequate housing.\" Carbon emissions and fracking On emissions reductions, Biden's plan calls for a carbon pollution-free U.S. power sector by 2035, with net-zero emissions throughout the economy by 2050. The Green New Deal's timeline is more aggressive, calling for a 10-year national mobilization to generate \"100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources.\" Both the Green New Deal and Biden's plan call for overhauling the American transportation industry to reduce pollution and"}], "source": "rag_only"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 5, "concluded_by_rag": true, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.0}

Usmani was the AMU student union chief in May 2018 when the university found itself mired in a controversy over a portrait of Muhammad Ali Jinnah on the premises. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala hit out at the BJP for raking up the controversy as part of its \u201chate factory\u201d.

{"claim": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said of US employers, \u201cEmployers cutting hours is a good thing. It then gives that person time to pursue their dreams and passions.\u201d", "label": "Refuted", "result": {"response": "To assess the factual accuracy of the statement attributed to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the statement.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statement**: The statement suggests that when employers cut hours, it is beneficial for employees because it allows them time to pursue their personal interests or dreams. This represents a positive spin on a potentially negative situation (reduced working hours).\n\n2. **Context of Employment and Wages**: The knowledge provided discusses the struggles of low-wage workers, particularly in the context of federal contractors and the minimum wage. It highlights how cuts in wages and hours can severely impact workers' ability to make ends meet, suggesting that the reality for many workers is quite the opposite of what the statement implies. \n\n3. **Implications of Hour Cuts**: Cutting hours typically results in reduced income for workers, which can exacerbate financial difficulties. The knowledge points emphasize the challenges faced by low-wage workers, indicating that the majority of employees would not view reduced hours as a positive development but rather as a detrimental one.\n\n4. **Reputation and Public Statements**: While it is possible that Pelosi could have made a statement emphasizing the importance of pursuing passions, the phrasing used in this particular statement appears contradictory to the struggles highlighted in the knowledge points. \n\nGiven the context and the implications of such a statement, it seems unlikely that Pelosi would genuinely endorse the idea that cutting hours is beneficial for workers, especially considering the broader conversation about wage increases and worker rights. \n\nTherefore, the statement attributed to Pelosi appears to be inaccurate or misrepresented.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "action will also help begin to close the racial wealth gap,\u201d noted National Employment Law Project (NELP) Executive Director Rebecca Dixon at the time. Trump\u2019s move could result in thousands of workers losing their pay increases, but its overall impact may be much more severe. A full overturning of the rule means that some federal contractors will return Obama-era wage of $13.30 an hour, but Trump could undo the minimum wage for these workers altogether, meaning that some contractors could make just $7.25 an hour in some states. \u201cLower-wage federal contractors include janitors who clean government buildings, food service workers on military bases, cashiers in gift shops in national parks and security guards protecting federal property,\u201d Samantha Sanders , the Economic Policy Institute\u2019s director of government affairs and advocacy, told Truthout . \u201cThis pay cut is a blatant attack on these workers \u2014 everyday people all across the country trying to make rent, buy groceries, and support their families.\u201d Lack of Enforcement Trump rolling back the Biden order doesn\u2019t mean the minimum wage for federal workers will immediately plummet. The DOL will have to go through a rulemaking process to determine how low to drop it. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that workers won\u2019t end up making less, as the DOL has announced it won\u2019t be enforcing the EO in the meantime. In other words, companies can illegally pay federal contractors less than the current minimum wage and face no consequences. It\u2019s just the latest example of the White House openly ignoring the law. Many workers technically have protections through labor laws like the McNamara-O\u2019Hara Service Contract Act and the Davis-Bacon Act, which are supposed to require prevailing wages by certain federal contractors. However, these laws have not been updated to keep up with inflation and are largely inadequate in the current economy. As a Center for American Progress report points out, many of the market wages established by these laws are less than the $17.75 hourly wage that Trump just nixed. \u201cA nursing assistant on a federal contract in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, has a minimum wage of only $13.17 ; a food service worker in parts of Mississippi, Tennessee, and Arkansas has a minimum wage of $12.06 ; and a landscape laborer on a construction site in Grand Rapids, Michigan, has a minimum wage of just $10.47 ,\u201d explains the report. Anti-Union Moves The Trump administration knows there is power\nin a statement. \u201cIn the year 2025, a job should lift you out of poverty, not keep you in it. At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, we can no longer tolerate millions of workers trying to survive on just $10 or $12 an hour. Congress can no longer ignore the needs of the working class of this country. The time to act is now.\u201d Earlier this month, Sanders forced a vote on the issue, as part of the Senate Budget Resolution, but it was rejected by the Republican majority. A report from the NELP notes that the bill would particularly benefit women and workers of color. The group estimates that Black workers would make an additional $3,200 a year; nearly 25 percent of Latino workers would see a raise; and 1 in 4 women would get paid more. It would also undoubtedly improve the overall economy. \u201cA $17 minimum wage by 2028 would generate $86 billion in higher wages for workers and would also benefit communities across the country,\u201d explains the report. \u201cBecause underpaid workers spend much of their extra earnings, this injection of wages will help stimulate the economy and spur greater business activity and job growth.\u201d On the campaign trail, and even after winning the election, Trump waffled on the issue of raising the minimum wage. When asked about potentially raising it in December 2024, he told NBC News , \u201cIt\u2019s a very low number, I will agree, it\u2019s a very low number. Let me give you the downside, though: In California, they raised it up to a very high number, and your restaurants are going out of business all over the place. The population is shrinking, it\u2019s had a very negative impact. But there is a level at which you could do it, absolutely.\u201d It\u2019s clear that Trump is no longer undecided on the issue. Media that fights fascism Truthout is funded almost entirely by readers \u2014 that\u2019s why we can speak truth to power and cut against the mainstream narrative. But independent journalists at Truthout face mounting political repression under Trump. We rely on your support to survive McCarthyist censorship.

The move was a clear act of retaliation against the AFGE, which represents TSA employees and has continually sought to restrain the administration in court. The TSA negotiated a seven-year labor agreement last year, which included the addition of parental bereavement leave and expanded shift trade options for workers. On April 8, Trump\u2019s attacks on the federal workforce got a boost from the right-wing Supreme Court. In a 7-2 ruling, the court paused an order from a San Francisco judge that required the administration to reinstate the more than 16,000 workers who were terminated earlier this year. Thousands more could be facing unemployment, thanks to a rule proposed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on April 18. The mandate would reclassify tens of thousands of federal workers as \u201cat-will\u201d employees, stripping them of civil service protections and enabling Trump to fire them en masse. \u201cMoving forward, career government employees, working on policy matters, will be classified as \u2018Schedule Policy/Career,\u2019 and will be held to the highest standards of conduct and performance,\u201d Trump wrote on social media after the rule was announced. \u201cIf these government workers refuse to advance the policy interests of the president, or are engaging in corrupt behavior, they should no longer have a job.\u201d The OPM estimates that 50,000 workers would be reclassified, which is about 2 percent of the federal workforce. Raise the Wage Act While Trump aims to reduce wages, many lawmakers are pushing to raise them. Led by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), Democrats recently reintroduced the Raise the Wage Act , which aims to bring the federal minimum wage up to $17 an hour by 2030. Despite the rapidly rising cost of living the United States, the federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 since 2009, the longest period without an increase since it was established in 1938. An economic analysis of the move suggests it could provide a raise for some 22 million people. \u201cThe $7.25 an hour minimum wage is a starvation wage. It must be raised to a living wage \u2014 at least $17 an hour,\u201d said Sanders in a statement. \u201cIn the year 2025, a job should lift you out of poverty, not keep you in it. At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, we can no longer tolerate millions of workers trying to survive on just $10 or $12 an hour. Congress can no\nHome Care Workers' Rights to Minimum Wage Must Be Protected Skip to main content The Trump Administration is trying to gut employment rights for home care workers through the federal rulemaking process . After many decades of organizing, home care workers finally won basic employment protections in 2015, including the right to federal minimum wage and overtime. They had been shut out from these basic employment rights for more than 75 years. In 1938, when Congress enacted the Fair Labor Standards Act, establishing federal minimum wage and overtime rights, home care workers were intentionally excluded from these protections . And in 1974, when minimum wage and overtime laws were extended to other domestic workers, many home care employers used regulatory loopholes meant for \u201ccompanions\u201d and \u201ccasual babysitters\u201d to continue to deny home care workers these rights. Many home care employers used regulatory loopholes meant for \u2018companions\u2019 and \u2018casual babysitters\u2019 to deny home care workers the most basic employment rights. As a result, a much-needed workforce of majority women, people of color, and immigrants continued to be underpaid for their essential work of bathing, changing dressings, and conducting other tasks that enable individuals to live at home. Meanwhile, the for-profit agencies employing home care workers pocketed most of the payments, including Medicaid reimbursements that cover in-home care, instead of paying decent wages. The Trump Administration plans to return to that time by getting rid of the protections workers won in 2015 by labeling home care workers exempt \u201ccompanions\u201d instead of employees. The results will be disastrous. An Essential Workforce Now Under Attack Most people with disabilities and older adults prefer to live at home, increasing the demand for in-home care and services. The industry has boomed since the mid-1970s, becoming one of the fastest-growing sectors, with a workforce that includes nearly three million home care workers . In response to these dramatic shifts, in 2011, President Obama instructed the Labor Department to rewrite the regulations to clarify that home care workers would be guaranteed the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour and time-and-a-half for overtime. The new rule was finalized in 2015. A decade later, Trump\u2019s Department of Labor (DOL) has proposed rulemaking to take away even those minimal protections. This is terrible policy for three reasons. First, home care worker wages are abysmally low, meaning they cannot feed their families and make ends meet. As of 2023 , \u201calmost\nthe minimum wage? You of course support a $15 federal minimum wage,\" Welker said at the debate. \"I do,\" Biden responded. During this exchange, Trump interjected, offering a position that wasn\u2019t as clear-cut in favor of a wage hike as Biden\u2019s was, but that also didn\u2019t close the door on it. Trump expressed concern that the wage hike could result in employers laying off lower-wage employees. \"How are you helping your small businesses when you\u2019re forcing wages? What\u2019s going to happen, and what\u2019s been proven to happen, is when you do that, these small businesses fire many of their employees,\" Trump said. Trump added his preference for state-by-state minimum wages. \"Alabama is different than New York. New York is different from Vermont. Every state is different. It should be a state option.\" (It\u2019s worth noting that no change would be required for this to happen, since states can already set a minimum wage higher than the federal level.) That said, Trump added that he\u2019d \"consider it to an extent \u2026 in a second administration. But not to a level that\u2019s going to put all these businesses out of business. It should be a state option.\" The 2019 minimum wage bill One thing that\u2019s clear is that the White House officially opposed a bill to enact $15 minimum wage in 2019. That came when the House was considering H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage Act . All but six Democrats voted for the measure while only three Republicans voted for it. The bill would phase in a $15 minimum wage over a seven-year period. As the measure was being considered in the House, the White House weighed in, as White Houses often do on major pieces of legislation, in a document known as a Statement of Administration Policy . The administration wrote that a $15 an hour minimum wage would \"reverse\" recent economic progress \"and hurt workers. \u2026 The successful efforts to reduce taxes, eliminate regulations, and implement fairer trade deals are driving economic growth and increasing workers\u2019 take-home pay far more effectively and efficiently than legislation like H.R. 582, which would eliminate jobs and reduce total wages for American workers.\" The document concluded that \"if H.R. 582 were presented to the president in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he veto it.\" The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry to clarify the president\u2019s current position.

In June, more than 50 liberal groups signed a letter to Biden calling on him to support defunding police and criticizing his promise to add $300 million for community policing programs. New interview Pence\u2019s statement followed a video interview Biden did with liberal activist Ady Barkan that posted July 8. The Biden campaign told us that the video was edited before being shared online. Barkan spent most of the 27-minute remote interview asking about health care. But about 20 minutes in, the discussion turned to George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, both of whom were killed in encounters with police. Alluding to demands made by Black Lives Matter, Barkan said deadly police encounters with citizens could be reduced if some police funding were redirected to social services, mental health counseling and affordable housing. \"Are you open to that kind of reform?\" he asked. Biden replied: \"Yes. I proposed that kind of reform.\" Biden said he has called for more mental health funding, as well as police reforms such as transparency in officer misconduct records. He did not speak directly about reducing police funding. Biden then talked about police using military equipment in their communities, which is where the \"enemy\" comment came up: \"Surplus military equipment for law enforcement \u2014 they don't need that. The last thing you need is an up-armored Humvee coming into a neighborhood; it's like the military invading. They don't know anybody; they become the enemy, they\u2019re supposed to be protecting these people.\" Barkan then interjected, asking: \"But do we agree that we can redirect some of\ndon't do the following, they don't get any help.\" Noting that most police funding comes from local and state governments, Biden continued, \"It's only the federal government comes in on top of that, and so it says, 'You want help? You have to do the following reforms: you have to make sure you have no-knock warrants eliminated, if you have them, you don't get Byrne grants. If you have them, boom.'\" In summary: Biden did say he is open to redirecting some funding. But he followed that comment by simply reiterating his previous proposal to reject federal funding for departments that do not meet certain conditions, not by taking a new stance. And a Biden campaign official said that Biden endorsing the idea of redirecting \"some of the funding\" is in line with his June comments about how it makes sense to reduce police budgets in \"some places.\" Bates, the Biden spokesman, said Trump is \"desperate to run against a fictitious opponent instead of Joe Biden.\" related Videos watch \u00b7 2:25 WRAL WeatherCenter Forecast watch \u00b7 1:28 Evening Pick 3 Pick 4 and Cash 5 watch \u00b7 0:59 Powerball Drawing watch \u00b7 1:22 Daytime Pick 3 and Pick 4 Drawing watch \u00b7 0:41 Mega Millions Drawing \u2022 Credits Copyright 2026 by Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

While understanding the age limit helps you assess the time you have to prepare, it\u2019s equally important to know what to prepare . You can check the detailed UPSC syllabus to get clarity on the subjects and to pics covered in both Prelims and Mains. UPSC Age Limit Relaxations for ST/SC/OBC The candidates who belong to SC or ST category, there is an age relaxation of up to a maximum of 5 years. For category from OBC category, the age relaxation is up to a maximum of 3 years . In case you are Defence Services personnel and got disabled while in combat with a hostile foreign country or in a disturbed area and are released, an age relaxation of up to a maximum of 3 years is given. For applicants who are an ex-serviceman, Commissioned Officer, or SSCO/ECO, having served 5 years in the Military and are released, there is an age relaxation of 5 years. This holds true for completion of service assignments, including the ones that are due to be completed within a year from the 1st of August 2025 , other than the way of discharge or dismissal on account of inefficiency or misconduct, or on account of being physically disabled due to military service , or on being invalid. A 5-year relaxation is given if you are an ECO/SSCO having completed an initial assignment period of 5 years of military service as of the 1st of August 2025, but the assignment has been extended beyond the 5 years period. In\nwho don\u2019t have access to coaching centres and recommended study material like their urban or semi-urban counterparts. People with internet access do seem to have some edge over those who don\u2019t. Another argument is that people with higher age would have more experience in life and possibly in career also. This experience could help them in their jobs as future administrators of the country. Moreover, it is the ability and intentions of a person that matter and not his or her age. Nobody should be barred from serving the country if they want to just because of the age factor. Even if the commission decides to make any changes, it should implement these changes over the course of a few years say, 5 or 6 years so that contemporary aspirants are not affected.

Skip to Content Donald Trump stages a check presentation with an enlarged copy of a $100,000 contribution from the Donald J. Trump Foundation to Puppy Jake, a veteran's charity, at a campaign event in Davenport, Iowa on Jan. 30, 2016. Paul Sancya / AP file Nov. 14, 2019, 4:50 AM EST / Updated Nov. 14, 2019, 5:47 PM EST By Philip Hackney Last week, Justice Saliann Scarpulla of the New York Supreme Court ordered President Donald Trump to pay $2 million in restitution to charity after admitting to New York Attorney General Letitia James that he and his children had violated their fiduciary duties as officers and directors of the now-shuttered Donald J. Trump Foundation . As a result of that failure, charitable dollars \u2014 consistently and over many years \u2014 often benefited Trump rather than the causes the president has repeatedly claimed he supports. The Trump Foundation has done great work and given away lots of money, both mine and others, to great charities over the years - with me taking NO fees, rent, salaries etc. Now, as usual, I am getting slammed by Cuomo and the Dems in a long running civil lawsuit started by..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 19, 2018 Scarpulla\u2019s Nov. 7 order, along with the stipulations obtained by the attorney general, are a great start to holding a wealthy family to account. Notably, such enforcement is rare. This is likely because of a serious lack of enforcement resources both at the state and federal levels. But I do not believe the judge\u2019s order should be the end of this matter . Charities must be publicly transparent; without transparency money dedicated to the public is subject to abuse. That abuse in turn undermines our confidence in a sector that provides services to some of our most vulnerable communities. But lost in the narrative about this decision \u2014 and indeed in this hectic news cycle \u2014 is the role of the IRS, the major regulator of nonprofits on a national scale. We still do not know whether the Trump Foundation and its officers and directors paid all the taxes it owed to the government, meaning the New York attorney general's investigation should be\nTrump had \"breached his fiduciary duty\" by allowing funds raised for US veterans to be used for the Iowa primary election in 2016. The money was raised in a televised fundraiser during a Republican primary debate that Mr Trump skipped. \"I direct Mr Trump to pay the $2,000,000, which would have gone to the Foundation if it were still in existence,\" the judge wrote, saying it must be paid by Mr Trump himself and should go to eight charities he has no relationship to. Mr Trump said the case had been resolved and that he was \"happy to donate\" $2m to the Army Emergency Relief, Children's Aid Society, City Meals-on-Wheels, Give an Hour, Martha's Table, United Negro College Fund, United Way of Capital Area and the US Holocaust Memorial Museum. Ms James said Mr Trump had admitted to \"personally misusing funds at the Trump Foundation\". She had asked Judge Scarpulla to ban Mr Trump from ever running a charity again. However, this was not imposed. Donald Trump Jr, Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump - who were also directors of the Trump Foundation - are required to undergo mandatory training \"on the duties of officers and directors of charities\", Ms James said. The case was opened following an investigation into the Trump Foundation by the Washington Post in 2016.

Trump Pays Court-Ordered $2 Million For Illegally Using Trump Foundation Funds Skip to main content Donald J. Trump Pays Court-Ordered $2 Million For Illegally Using Trump Foundation Funds December 10, 2019 Trump Ordered to Pay Eight Separate Charities $250,000 Each Remaining $1.8 Million in Trump Foundation Bank Account Disbursed Among Charities NEW YORK \u2013 New York Attorney General Letitia James today released the following statement after Donald J. Trump was forced to pay more than $2 million in court-ordered damages to eight different charities for illegally misusing charitable funds at the Trump Foundation for political purposes: \u201cNot only has the Trump Foundation shut down for its misconduct, but the president has been forced to pay $2 million for misusing charitable funds for his own political gain. Charities are not a means to an end, which is why these damages speak to the president\u2019s abuse of power and represent a victory for not-for-profits that follow the law. Funds have finally gone where they deserve \u2014 to eight credible charities. My office will continue to fight for accountability because no one is above the law \u2014 not a businessman, not a candidate for office, and not even the president of the United States.\u201d As part of a resolution of the lawsuit announced on November 7 th , Trump was ordered to pay $2 million, or $250,000, a piece to eight different charities. Those charities are Army Emergency Relief, the Children\u2019s Aid Society, Citymeals-on-Wheels, Give an Hour, Martha\u2019s Table, the United Negro College Fund, the United Way of National Capital Area, and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Additionally, Trump was forced to reimburse his namesake foundation $11,525 for sports paraphernalia and champagne purchased at a charity gala, which was added to $1,797,598.30 already in the foundation\u2019s bank account. The combined $1,809,123.30 was split evenly and recently transferred to the eight agreed upon charities. Each charity ended up receiving a total of $476,140.41. Additionally, as part of the settlement, Trump was required to agree to 19 admissions , acknowledging his personal misuse of funds at the Trump Foundation, and agreed to restrictions on future charitable service and ongoing reporting to the Office of the Attorney General, in the event he creates a new charity. The settlement also included mandatory training requirements for Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump, which the three children have already undergone. Finally, the settlement required the\nfoundation like a parasite taking over its host. Trump ordered to pay $2M after misusing his charity in 'shocking pattern of illegality' 03:16 At the center of this controversy is a 2016 nationally televised Iowa fundraiser, ostensibly organized by the foundation to raise money for veterans. Instead, Trump's presidential campaign used the foundation to promote Trump and to draw attention away from a Fox News debate taking place at the same time. The foundation did in fact raise money during the event, $2.8 million, which it publicly donated out to at least five different Iowa charities, ceremonially handing over a large check emblazoned with Trump's campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again.\" In effect, the New York judge found that Trump's fundraiser was just as much a way to help his presidential campaign as it was to help former members of the armed services. The attorney general had asked the court to order Trump to return the entire amount that was raised that day, or $2.8 million. But Scarpulla believed the monetary harm was somewhat lessened since the foundation did ultimately give money to charity, ordering $2 million in restitution. But that is not the end of the matter. If the Trump Foundation was participating in political campaigns, which New York State says it was, it and Trump would then owe back taxes to the IRS. The foundation is a special type of charity called a private foundation . Private foundations are typically formed and generally controlled by wealthy families, and Congress imposes significant, strict rules upon them. Lawmakers are clearly concerned that this type of situation, which today is illustrated by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Ford Foundation and the Walton Family Foundation, is ripe for abuse. And the Trump Foundation's actions suggest Congress is right to be worried. The rules imposed are particularly relevant to the Trump situation. One tax prohibits what is known as self-dealing . It is an excise tax of 10 percent of the amount taken from charity. And as Trump admits in the stipulations with the attorney general, he repeatedly violated the self-dealing rule. Congress also imposes an excise tax on foundations that spend money on political campaigns. The foundation and Trump are already familiar with this rule as well. Congress also imposes an excise tax on foundations that spend money on political campaigns. The foundation and Trump are already familiar with this\nsomebody that knows most of those people.

I would blow away every record, but I don't want to do that because it puts me in a bad position.\" FACT CHECK: Trump targeted Biden for raising money for his campaign by claiming he could raise more but would be put in a \"bad position\" because he would owe donors something in return. However, Trump himself regularly holds private, high-dollar fundraisers raking in millions of dollars and has raised over $1.5 billion so far this election cycle.

Additionally, the mention of a World Bank report indicating 139 million Nigerians still in poverty implies that poverty is one of the pressing challenges.\n\nIn summary, the statement accurately reflects the current population size of Nigeria as exceeding 200 million, and it is reasonable to infer that this large population is associated with multiple challenges, even though specific challenges are not detailed in the provided KNOWLEDGE.\n\nThus, based on the analysis, the statement is factually accurate.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"True\"\n}\n```", "answer": "True"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "IPPIS CIVIL/PUBLIC SERVANTS DISCUSSION GROUP (ICPSDG) | I\u2019m not sure how accurate this statistic is, but if it\u2019s true, then Nigeria\u2019s situation looks increasingly bleak\nNigeria\u2019s Population: A Burden or an Opportunity? - YouTube About Press Copyright Contact us Creator Advertise Developers Terms Privacy Policy & Safety How YouTube works Test new features \u00a9 2026 Google LLC\nThe 2023 Census will be Nigeria's first Digital Census and will change how the Census is being conducted in Nigeria before now.\nWorld Bank Report: 139 Million Nigerians Still in Poverty - YouTube About Press Copyright Contact us Creator Advertise Developers Terms Privacy Policy & Safety How YouTube works Test new features \u00a9 2026 Google LLC\n] Age Population Percent Total 140,431,790 100 0\u20134 22,594,967 16.09 5\u20139 20,005,380 14.25 10\u201314 16,135,950 11.49 15\u201319 14,899,419 10.61 20\u201324 13,435,079 9.57 25\u201329 12,211,426 8.70 30\u201334 9,467,538 6.74 35\u201339 7,331,755 5.22 40\u201344 6,456,470 4.60 45\u201349 4,591,293 3.27 50\u201354 4,249,219 3.03 55\u201359 2,066,247 1.47 60\u201364 2,450,286 1.74 65\u201369 1,151,048 0.82 70\u201374 1,264,937 0.95 75\u201379 579,838 0.41 80\u201384 760,053 0.54 85+ 715,225 0.51 Age group Total Male Female % 0\u201314 58,736,297 30,462,148 28,274,149 41.83 15\u201364 77,158,732 38,348,799 38,809,933 54.94 65+ 4,536,761 2,534,541 2,002,220 3.23 Population by age group (estimates 1.VII.2016) (Data are projections based on the 2006 Population Census.)

This type of judicial discretion is already granted in statutory rape cases involving a man who has vaginal sexual intercourse with a minor. However, it didn\u2019t include circumstances in which an adult engaged in consensual oral or anal sex with a minor. The old law was considered by many to discriminate against young LGBTQ individuals who engage in relationships with minors close to them in age by forcing them to register as a sex offender when heterosexuals in the same situation weren\u2019t required to register. Controversy still surrounds the law, however, because it allows a ten-year age gap in these relationships. Some opponents claim that the law protects pedophilia, no matter to whom it applies. The law was created for situations like those in which two teenagers are in a relationship and one reaches the age of 18 before the other. However, those against the law point out that it could also apply to a 24-year-old having sex with a 14-year-old, which they feel is unacceptable. The Initial Sex Offender Law The sex offender law that has been in place for decades in California gives judges the ability to decide if a man should be placed on the sex offender registry if he has voluntary sexual intercourse with a female between the ages of fourteen and seventeen and is no more than ten years older than the female. The age of consent in California is eighteen. Any adult engaging in sex with someone under the age of eighteen may face statutory rape charges. This aspect of California law remains unchanged; it is only the issue of the sex offender registry that is affected. When an adult is ordered to register as a sex offender, it is a lifelong order. The New Law and Its Implications The law was changed when SB 145 went into effect in September. Under the new law, the age of consent remains the same, and nothing changes when minors under\nfor decades, permits judges to decide whether a man should be placed on California's sex offender registry if he had voluntary intercourse with someone 14 to 17 years old and was no more than 10 years older than the person.But that discretion only applied to a man who had vaginal intercourse. The new change permits judges to use that same discretion when the case involves voluntary oral or anal sex.The measure won't apply when a minor is under 14, when the age gap is larger than 10 years, or when either party says the sex wasn't consensual.The law does not change the age of consent in California, which is 18. Adults caught having sex with minors will still face statutory rape charges.The bill was introduced by state Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat.The law ends discrimination \u201cby treating LGBTQ young people the exact same way that straight young people have been treated since 1944,\" Wiener said in a statement, adding: \u201cToday, California took yet another step toward an equitable society.\u201dEquality California, a nonprofit civil rights group that co-sponsored the bill with the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, also applauded Newsom's signing.\u201cIf we want a California for all, then we need a justice system that treats all Californians fairly and equally - regardless of who they are, what they look like or whom they love,\" Executive Director Rick Chavez Zbur said in the statement released by Wiener's office.The bill passed the Assembly and Senate on split votes, with some members objecting to what they saw as an easing of punishments against those who have sex with minors.\u201cI cannot in my mind as a mother understand how sex between a 24-year-old and a 14-year-old could ever be consensual, how it could ever not be a registrable offense,\u201d Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, D-San Diego, said before the bill's passage. \u201cWe should never give up on this idea that children should be in no way subject to a predator.\u201dOnline critics had falsely blasted the measure as legalizing pedophilia.The bill was supported by civil rights groups as well as the California District Attorneys Association and California Police Chiefs Association.

The New Law and Its Implications The law was changed when SB 145 went into effect in September. Under the new law, the age of consent remains the same, and nothing changes when minors under the age of thirteen are involved. The change simply alters the terms to make the law applicable to oral, anal sex, and vaginal sex, as opposed to vaginal sex alone. This gives judges discretion on whether to order sex offender registry for gay men involved with minors less than ten years younger than them. In contrast, they would have automatically been made to register previously. L.A. County District Attorney, Jackie Lacey, said, \u201cThis bill allows judges and prosecutors to evaluate cases involving consensual sex acts between young people, regardless of their sexual orientation, on an individual basis.\u201d Some Groups Show Support Although the law is still controversial, due to its very nature, some groups have lauded the change. The nonprofit civil rights group Equality California co-sponsored the new bill and supported Governor Newsom signing it into law. Their official statement said, \u201cIf we want a California for all, then we need a justice system that treats all Californians fairly and equally \u2013 regardless of who they are, what they look like, or whom they love.\u201d The law was also praised by Senator Scott Weiner, who introduced the bill. Some Express Outrage However, opponents of the bill maintain that the ten-year age gap is too liberal and allows for predatory behavior to go unpunished. It is assumed that judges wouldn\u2019t allow such cases to slip through the system, as the point of the law is not to make things easier on those guilty of sex crimes but instead to sort of bridge the gap in a complicated area. Lorena Gonzalez, a Democratic assemblywoman from San Diego, is one of those who spoke out against the law. She explained, \u201cI cannot, in my mind, as a mother, understand how sex between a 24-year-old and a 14-year-old could ever be consensual, how it could ever not be a registerable offense.\u201d Shannon Grove, California\u2019s Senate Republican Leader, is another opponent who spoke out against the new law.

Skip to Content Donald Trump stages a check presentation with an enlarged copy of a $100,000 contribution from the Donald J. Trump Foundation to Puppy Jake, a veteran's charity, at a campaign event in Davenport, Iowa on Jan. 30, 2016. Paul Sancya / AP file Nov. 14, 2019, 4:50 AM EST / Updated Nov. 14, 2019, 5:47 PM EST By Philip Hackney Last week, Justice Saliann Scarpulla of the New York Supreme Court ordered President Donald Trump to pay $2 million in restitution to charity after admitting to New York Attorney General Letitia James that he and his children had violated their fiduciary duties as officers and directors of the now-shuttered Donald J. Trump Foundation . As a result of that failure, charitable dollars \u2014 consistently and over many years \u2014 often benefited Trump rather than the causes the president has repeatedly claimed he supports. The Trump Foundation has done great work and given away lots of money, both mine and others, to great charities over the years - with me taking NO fees, rent, salaries etc. Now, as usual, I am getting slammed by Cuomo and the Dems in a long running civil lawsuit started by..... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 19, 2018 Scarpulla\u2019s Nov. 7 order, along with the stipulations obtained by the attorney general, are a great start to holding a wealthy family to account. Notably, such enforcement is rare. This is likely because of a serious lack of enforcement resources both at the state and federal levels. But I do not believe the judge\u2019s order should be the end of this matter . Charities must be publicly transparent; without transparency money dedicated to the public is subject to abuse. That abuse in turn undermines our confidence in a sector that provides services to some of our most vulnerable communities. But lost in the narrative about this decision \u2014 and indeed in this hectic news cycle \u2014 is the role of the IRS, the major regulator of nonprofits on a national scale. We still do not know whether the Trump Foundation and its officers and directors paid all the taxes it owed to the government, meaning the New York attorney general's investigation should be\nrule. Congress also imposes an excise tax on foundations that spend money on political campaigns. The foundation and Trump are already familiar with this rule as well. Congress also imposes an excise tax on foundations that spend money on political campaigns. The foundation and Trump are already familiar with this rule as well, because Trump paid $2,500 to the IRS in a 2016 filing on behalf of the foundation after admitting to improperly sending $25,000 to the Pam Bondi campaign for attorney general in Florida in 2013. I believe that Trump and the Trump Foundation owe taxes at least pursuant to both categories above: Trump should owe a 10 percent self-dealing excise tax on that $2 million amount from the Iowa event, and a second 10 percent tax because of the event's political implications. Given that the foundation is shutting down and all other assets are supposedly being directed to charity, I believe Trump ought to pay both amounts personally, a total of $400,000. Now, it\u2019s likely that the Trump Foundation has actually violated other laws. For instance, until at least May of this year, Trump still had not paid the foundation for seemingly personal purchases totaling in the tens of thousands of dollars. The foundation now claims that those amounts have been repaid or will soon be repaid. But can we trust an organization with such a shady track record to hold itself accountable? Related Opinion Opinion We want to hear what you THINK. Please submit a letter to the editor. I would argue no, and I remain concerned about the president\u2019s operation of the foundation. Year after year, he signed the foundation\u2019s tax information returns. And now we know those returns contained false information. There has also been significant reporting about potentially improper estate and gift tax positions he and his family have taken advantage over many years. The culmination of this information suggests there is a real need for the IRS to make sure the Trump Foundation is held fully responsible for its fraud. And to do that, the IRS should really also do an independent audit of the president\u2019s own tax returns. The president's personal and charitable endeavors are so enmeshed, it would seem impossible to entangle one without full knowledge of the other. Scarpulla and James' efforts here are to be commended, but much work remains in holding Trump to account \u2014 at least in\nTrump had \"breached his fiduciary duty\" by allowing funds raised for US veterans to be used for the Iowa primary election in 2016. The money was raised in a televised fundraiser during a Republican primary debate that Mr Trump skipped. \"I direct Mr Trump to pay the $2,000,000, which would have gone to the Foundation if it were still in existence,\" the judge wrote, saying it must be paid by Mr Trump himself and should go to eight charities he has no relationship to. Mr Trump said the case had been resolved and that he was \"happy to donate\" $2m to the Army Emergency Relief, Children's Aid Society, City Meals-on-Wheels, Give an Hour, Martha's Table, United Negro College Fund, United Way of Capital Area and the US Holocaust Memorial Museum. Ms James said Mr Trump had admitted to \"personally misusing funds at the Trump Foundation\". She had asked Judge Scarpulla to ban Mr Trump from ever running a charity again. However, this was not imposed. Donald Trump Jr, Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump - who were also directors of the Trump Foundation - are required to undergo mandatory training \"on the duties of officers and directors of charities\", Ms James said. The case was opened following an investigation into the Trump Foundation by the Washington Post in 2016.

Charities are not a means to an end, which is why these damages speak to the president\u2019s abuse of power and represent a victory for not-for-profits that follow the law. Funds have finally gone where they deserve \u2014 to eight credible charities. My office will continue to fight for accountability because no one is above the law \u2014 not a businessman, not a candidate for office, and not even the president of the United States.\u201d As part of a resolution of the lawsuit announced on November 7 th , Trump was ordered to pay $2 million, or $250,000, a piece to eight different charities. Those charities are Army Emergency Relief, the Children\u2019s Aid Society, Citymeals-on-Wheels, Give an Hour, Martha\u2019s Table, the United Negro College Fund, the United Way of National Capital Area, and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Additionally, Trump was forced to reimburse his namesake foundation $11,525 for sports paraphernalia and champagne purchased at a charity gala, which was added to $1,797,598.30 already in the foundation\u2019s bank account. The combined $1,809,123.30 was split evenly and recently transferred to the eight agreed upon charities. Each charity ended up receiving a total of $476,140.41. Additionally, as part of the settlement, Trump was required to agree to 19 admissions , acknowledging his personal misuse of funds at the Trump Foundation, and agreed to restrictions on future charitable service and ongoing reporting to the Office of the Attorney General, in the event he creates a new charity. The settlement also included mandatory training requirements for Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump, which the three children have already undergone.

Rating: False About this rating In September 2020, as social media users accused Netflix of promoting pedophilia due to a promotional poster for the award-winning French film \"Cuties,\" the website TorontoToday.net published an article claiming that Reed Hastings, the streaming service's CEO, had been arrested on suspicion of possession of child pornography: This is not a genuine news report. Hastings was not arrested by the FBI, and the accusations circulating on social media that the Netflix CEO was involved in child pornography are baseless and largely driven by pedophilia panic that consumed portions of the internet in 2020. Hasting is the CEO of one of the world's largest streaming services. If he truly had been arrested by the FBI, it would certainly warrant a press release from the FBI, and would undoubtedly make headlines in credible media outlets. However, the only source for this news appears to be random social media posts and an article published to a website with a history of spreading misinformation. TorontoToday.net is a relatively new website, but it has already been responsible for at least two viral hoaxes. Shortly after Black Panther actor Chadwick Boseman died from colon cancer, the website published a false report claiming that he had been poisoned. The website was also responsible for the false rumor that Russian President Vladimir Putin's daughter had died from a COVID-19 vaccine. The website deleted its false report about Hasting's arrest, but an archived version of the page can be found here . It appears that TorontoToday.net originally published this article under the headline \"Netflix CEO gets BUSTED with 13,000 files of CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.\" Then, the site updated the article to include the word \"reports\" before the headline, and deleted the original text of the article claiming a\nnature of the sexual abuse, and evidence of a \"clandestine drug lab\" discovered during the raid. The website Toronto Today has been responsible for multiple other misinformation hoaxes in the past few months, per Snopes and Lead Stories . Netflix did not respond to a request for comment on behalf of Hastings. Our rating: False Based on our research, the claim that Netflix CEO Reed Hastings was arrested for child pornography is FALSE. The claim appeared in an article from a website with a record of misinformation, according to other fact-checkers, and details from that article appeared to have been lifted from a report on an unrelated arrest of another individual in December 2019.

This fake report about the arrest of Netflix CEO Reed Hasting is just the latest in a long series of false rumors concerning pedophilia. In 2020, pedophilia panic consumed portions of the internet, in large part because these false rumors were being amplified by the growing QAnon conspiracy movement. In the last few months alone, we've covered false rumors about furniture stores trafficking children via large cabinets , department stores promoting pedophilia by selling shirts containing images of pizza , and the country of Greece classifying pedophilia as a disability. While pedophilia and sex trafficking are certainly real issues, the aforementioned stories are false. In fact, the National Human Trafficking Hotline released a statement saying that these pedophilia conspiracy theories were making it more difficult to help people who are actually in danger of being trafficked.

Amid the controversy, unfounded claims about Netflix CEO Reed Hastings have swirled on social media. Posts on Facebook and Instagram included a screenshot of a headline that claimed \"Netflix CEO gets BUSTED with 13,000 files of CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.\" The headline came from an article on the webpage Toronto Today. The story \u2014 which was archived on Sept. 12 prior to its removal from the site \u2014 claimed that Hastings was arrested at his home in California and faces \"11 charges related to the seizure of more than 13,000 files of graphic child pornography on his computer and various removable storage units.\" The users behind the posts did not respond to requests from USA TODAY for comment. Toronto Today denied being the original source of the false story, and noted in an email to USA TODAY that Netflix and Hastings have faced accusations of distributing child pornography since the release of \"Cuties.\" Story is false, details taken from an unrelated arrest of someone else in December 2019 The claims in the screenshots and the story from Toronto Today are false.

The appropriate use, storage and cleaning or disposal of masks are essential to make them as effective as possible. Here are the basics of how to wear a mask : Clean your hands before you put your mask on, as well as before and after you take it off, and after you touch it at any time. Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin. When you take off a mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every day either wash it if it\u2019s a fabric mask, or dispose of a medical mask in a trash bin. Don\u2019t use masks with valves.

How to properly fit your mask WHO\u2019s\nHow well do face masks protect against COVID-19? - Mayo Clinic How well do face masks protect against COVID-19? Get answers to your questions about face masks, including how to use them properly. By Mayo Clinic Staff Oct. 29, 2025 The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly through the air when a person coughs, sneezes, sings, talks or breathes. Virus particles can drift in the air and be inhaled, especially in crowded places with poor airflow. Face masks or respirators are products that cover the nose, mouth and chin. Most research finds that these products can slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 when they are worn consistently, fit properly and are worn correctly. Wear a mask if you have symptoms of illness, if you are near others who are sick or if you're in a crowded indoor area. This is especially important if COVID-19 illness rates in your area are high. But face masks aren't safe for everyone. Don't put a mask on anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious or otherwise unable to remove the mask without help. And don't put masks on children younger than age 2. How do different types of masks work? Face masks differ in how well they filter air and fit on the face. Masks also differ on how easy or hard they are to breathe through. Some masks rely on fabric type, weave or density to filter the air.

Get answers to your questions about face masks, including how to use them properly. By Mayo Clinic Staff Oct. 29, 2025 The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly through the air when a person coughs, sneezes, sings, talks or breathes. Virus particles can drift in the air and be inhaled, especially in crowded places with poor airflow. Face masks or respirators are products that cover the nose, mouth and chin. Most research finds that these products can slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 when they are worn consistently, fit properly and are worn correctly. Wear a mask if you have symptoms of illness, if you are near others who are sick or if you're in a crowded indoor area. This is especially important if COVID-19 illness rates in your area are high. But face masks aren't safe for everyone. Don't put a mask on anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious or otherwise unable to remove the mask without help. And don't put masks on children younger than age 2. How do different types of masks work? Face masks differ in how well they filter air and fit on the face. Masks also differ on how easy or hard they are to breathe through. Some masks rely on fabric type, weave or density to filter the air. Other masks use a static charge, like the static charge that causes clothes to stick together in the dryer, to catch and hold the virus. Some masks use both strategies as well as others.

It remains live for reference purposes only. Why should people wear masks? Wearing a mask reduces the spread of respiratory illnesses within the community by reducing the number of infectious particles that may be inhaled or exhaled. These particles may be spread when an infected individual talks, sings, shouts, coughs, or sneezes (even if not symptomatic). Hence, masks may provide protection to the wearer and those around them. Masks are one component of a package of prevention and control measures to limit the spread of COVID-19. In addition to mask wearing, these measures include avoiding crowded spaces, avoiding poorly ventilated spaces and improving ventilation in indoor spaces, keeping a distance, hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette - covering your mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze, getting vaccinated and staying up to date with booster doses. Be supportive of others wearing a mask if they choose to. When should masks be worn by the public? To help reduce the spread of COVID-19, WHO recommends wearing a mask: When in a crowded, enclosed or poorly ventilation area (eg. you are unable to maintain distance). If you have any doubts regarding the quality of ventilation, wear a mask. If you have or think you might have COVID-19, when sharing a space with others: If you feel unwell and have any of the signs and symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 If you recently tested positive for COVID-19 with or without symptoms If you recently had contact (exposure) to someone who has tested positive for or displays symptoms of COVID-19 When sharing a space with someone who has symptoms of COVID-19 or is COVID-19 positive When you are in a public space, and you are at high risk of becoming seriously ill with COVID-19 or dying . For example, if you have underlying health conditions (such as diabetes, heart or lung disease, cancer, immunosuppression, history of stroke and/or asthma) or if you are 60 years or older. In other situations, not included in the above, you should assess your individual risk to determine if a mask should be worn. When deciding to wear a mask or not, the following should be considered: If COVID-19 infections are increasing in your community or there is"}], "source": "rag_only"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 5, "concluded_by_rag": true, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.0}

The KNOWLEDGE indicates that Dr. Anthony Fauci initially recommended against mask usage for the public, citing concerns about PPE shortages for healthcare workers. This suggests that early in the pandemic, there was caution regarding mask usage among the general public.\n\n2. **Evolving Guidance**: The KNOWLEDGE also states that by the end of March 2020, Dr. Fauci mentioned that recommending face coverings was under \"serious consideration,\" and by April, both he and the CDC began recommending masks in certain settings to help slow the spread of COVID-19. This indicates a shift in the messaging from the initial stance against masks to one of support for their use.\n\n3. **Evidence for Efficacy**: The KNOWLEDGE includes references to studies and systematic reviews that demonstrate the effectiveness of masks in reducing the transmission of respiratory viruses, including COVID-19. For instance, it mentions that clinical trials have shown masks can reduce transmission risk and that mandates were associated with decreased COVID-19 growth rates.\n\n4. **Context of Statements**: The initial recommendation against masks was made in a specific context\u2014primarily due to concerns over supply for healthcare professionals, not necessarily a definitive claim about their ineffectiveness in general.\n\nBased on these points, the STATEMENT that \"the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control both previously said that \u2018masks are not effective in preventing [the] general public from catching coronavirus\u2019\" seems to be an oversimplification and lacks context. While there was an initial hesitance to recommend masks broadly, this was later revised as evidence emerged supporting their effectiveness.\n\nThus, the final assessment of the STATEMENT is that it is misleading and not entirely accurate.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "here Carl Heneghan is Professor of Evidence-Based Medicine, University of Oxford, Director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine and Editor in Chief of BMJ EBM (Full bio and disclosure statement here ) The views expressed in this viewpoint represent the views of the authors and not necessarily those of the host institution, the NHS, the NIHR, or the Department of Health.

COVID-19 podcast EBM Podcast TRIP Database COVID-19 updates CEBM Learning\nof Jefferson et al [ 5 ] are at odds with clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of masks in protecting uninfected individuals from COVID-19 [ 6 , 7 ]. Clinical trials have also shown that masks reduce the risk of transmission of influenza or SARS-CoV-2 from previously infected individuals [ 8 ]. A key advantage of studies that are based on real-world data is their high external validity. As such, they can significantly complement the evidence from RCTs on the efficacy of face masks in protecting against ARIs. ARIs can be most effectively prevented at the population level when masks are worn by both susceptible and infectious individuals [ 8 , 9 ]. Following this line of reasoning, the World Health Organization issued a recommendation to publicly wear face masks to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 [ 10 ]. This recommendation has been adopted by countries around the world by implementing face mask mandates in 2020. As some countries and regions did not introduce any face mask policies, 3 studies used this fact to identify the causal effect of mandates on SARS-CoV-2 infections. Lyu and Wehby [ 11 ] conducted a natural experiment with real-world data to show that mandates in 15 states of the United States and Washington, District of Columbia, resulted in reductions in COVID-19 growth rates of up to 19%. Another study using real-world data from the Global COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS) found mask mandates in the United States to be related to decreases in daily new cases, daily new deaths, daily new hospital admissions, and increases in population shares wearing masks [ 12 ]. These findings are corroborated by Mitze et al [ 13 ], who, using a synthetic control design, found a 47% reduction in daily COVID-19 case growth rates attributable to a local mask mandate in Jena, Germany. In addition, 2 other population-level studies found evidence for a direct association between wearing face masks and COVID-19 outcomes. Controlling for time-constant unobserved heterogeneity, Rader et al [ 14 ] report decreasing growth rates of COVID-19 cases with increasing state-specific proportions of face mask wearers at the US state level. Leffler et al [ 15 ] use a cross-sectional design across 196 countries and observe that longer durations of face mask use are inversely associated with COVID-19 mortality. Objectives To our knowledge, no real-world studies have been conducted to compare the effects of face\nnot to wear masks.\" Verdict: This needs context. At the start of the outbreak, Dr Anthony Fauci, the White House top infectious disease expert, recommended the US public didn't wear face coverings. But he says his early comments have been taken out of context, claiming he was initially cautious because there was a shortage of PPE for healthcare professionals. In early March, Dr Fauci said: \"It could lead to a shortage of masks for the people who really need it.\" By the end of March, Fauci said recommending face coverings outside a healthcare setting was under \"serious consideration\". Since April, Dr Fauci as well as the CDC have recommended the use of face coverings in certain settings to help slow the spread of coronavirus. Biden: \"We have 4% of the world's population, [but] 20% of the deaths\". Verdict: This is roughly correct. The US population is around 328 million, which is just over 4% of the 7.7 billion global population. There have been over 225,000 coronavirus deaths recorded in the US, according to the latest John Hopkins University data. The total number of deaths recorded worldwide is around 1,161,000. On this metric, the US accounts for over 19% of Covid-19 deaths worldwide, although the way countries record their figures varies considerably.

In public spaces, facemasks have played a crucial role in preventing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While facemasks were recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in June 2020, there is still a lack of scientific evidence regarding the epidemiological efficacy of facemasks against COVID-19 transmission .

Image Credit: Chaiwat Subprasom / Shutterstock *Important notice: medRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information. About the study In the present study, researchers analyzed the efficiency of facemasks in curbing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the community as well as healthcare settings. The team performed a systematic review to identify relevant studies. A literature search was conducted by a medical librarian using Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science library between April and August 2020. The team subsequently deduplicated the citations using Covidence.org. Articles in only the English language were retrieved for the study, while all conference proceedings were excluded. The findings were reported as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. Three study team members reviewed the libraries to yield 1,732 articles. Among these, 61 full-text articles met the required criteria. Subsequently, a total of 13 studies were assessed in the study. The team estimated relative risk, frequencies, t-tests, and confidence intervals where necessary to calculate the variation between cohorts that did and did not report the usage of facemasks in the entire study group and community and healthcare settings. Results The study results showed that a total of 1,539 subjects were analyzed from 13 studies, including four community-based and nine healthcare-based studies. Among these, 243 subjects had SARS-CoV-2 infections, including 97 who did and 146 who did not wear facemasks. The team noted that the probability of contracting a COVID-19 disease was 7% for mask wearers and 52% for non-mask wearers. The relative risk of getting infected by SARS-CoV-2\nmay be able to catch droplets and sputum from a cough, but what is important is that SARS CoV-2 is predominantly distributed by aerosols that are much smaller than droplets. These aerosols are carried in the flow of air as someone breathes, and are significantly smaller than the pore / perforation size of common mask materials. All common types of masks also suffer from leakage through gaps around the edges, rendering them ineffective. Any higher grade mask (really designed for specialist industrial applications) that is not professionally fitted will also likely be ineffective due to leakage. The world-wide data that is now available from places where mask mandates were imposed consistently shows no measurable effect on infection spread. Added to that, inappropriate use of various computer modelling methods has resulted in misleading evidence being used to promote the efficacy of masks in preventing transmission, which they simply do not do.\u201d Co-chair Graham Stringer MP said : \u201cThe new Prime Minister and Health Secretary should not impose mask wearing again unless they can produce high quality evidence that the benefits far outweigh the harms to the individual and society as a whole. Our APPG has heard from experts that this evidence does not appear to exist and so policy makers should not be reintroducing such measures on a \u2018just in case\u2019 basis. Individuals have always been, and continue to be, free to wear a mask should they so choose, and it should remain an individual choice.\u201d View the full minutes for this meeting, held on Monday 17 October 2022.

{"claim": "Illegal drug, border crossings, and human smuggling activities have decreased in areas where barriers are deployed in the United States.", "label": "Not Enough Evidence", "result": {"response": "To evaluate the factual accuracy of the statement \"Illegal drug, border crossings, and human smuggling activities have decreased in areas where barriers are deployed in the United States,\" let's analyze the provided knowledge points step-by-step.\n\n1. **Border Barriers and Their Purpose**: The knowledge indicates that barriers, including fencing, have been constructed along the U.S.-Mexico border. The intent behind these barriers is to reduce illegal crossings and drug trafficking.\n\n2. **Apprehension Statistics**: The statistics provided show that while border apprehensions by the Border Patrol were significantly high in the past (e.g., 1,189,000 in 2005), they decreased to 463,000 in 2010, attributed to various factors including border enforcement efforts. However, the knowledge also mentions that 80% of those apprehended are not Mexican, indicating that the dynamics of border crossings are complex and not solely influenced by physical barriers.\n\n3. **Effectiveness of Barriers**: The knowledge suggests that while barriers may deter crossings in some areas, they have also led to an increase in crossings in more inhospitable areas, such as deserts and mountains. This implies that barriers may not universally decrease illegal crossings or smuggling activities; instead, they might shift the locations where these activities occur.\n\n4. **Claims of Decreased Activities**: The statement claims a decrease in illegal drug activities and human smuggling in areas with barriers. While the knowledge references the operational capacity of border enforcement and drug seizures, it does not provide clear evidence that drug trafficking and human smuggling have decreased in areas where barriers exist. It only notes that barriers help shape the behavior of cartels and improve operational capacity.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the knowledge provided, it is not definitively supported that illegal drug activities and human smuggling have decreased in areas with barriers. The evidence suggests that while barriers may have some deterrent effect, they can also lead to increased crossings in other areas. Therefore, the statement is not accurate as it presents a generalized conclusion without sufficient supporting evidence.\n\nGiven this analysis, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "to the end of his second term. [ 13 ] Description [ edit ] The 1,954-mile (3,145-kilometer) border between Mexico and the U.S. traverses a variety of terrain, including urban areas and deserts. [ 14 ] The border from the Gulf of Mexico to El Paso, Texas , follows the Rio Grande , a natural barrier. The barrier is on both urban and uninhabited sections of the border, where the most illegal crossings and drug trafficking have been observed in the past. These urban areas include San Diego , California, and El Paso, Texas. [ 15 ] The fencing includes a steel fence (varying in height between 18 and 27 feet (4.8 and 8.1 meters)) that divides the border towns of Nogales, Arizona , in the U.S. and Nogales, Sonora , in Mexico. [ 16 ] 97% of border apprehensions (foreign nationals caught in the U.S. illegally) by the Border Patrol in 2010 occurred at the southwest border. The number declined 61% from 1,189,000 in 2005 to 723,842 in 2008 to 463,000 in 2010. The decrease in apprehensions is the result of numerous factors, including changes in U.S. economic conditions and border enforcement efforts. Border apprehensions in 2010 were at their lowest level since 1972. [ 15 ] [ 17 ] Total apprehensions for 2017, 2018, and 2019 were 415,517, 521,090, and 977,509, respectively. [ 18 ] And while the barrier is along the border with Mexico, 80% of those apprehended are not Mexican. [ 19 ] As a result of the barrier, the number of people trying to cross in areas that have no fence, such as the Sonoran Desert and the Baboquivari Mountains in Arizona, has increased. [ 20 ] Such immigrants must cross 50 miles (80 km) of inhospitable terrain to reach the first road, which is in the Tohono O\u02bcodham Indian Reservation . [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Geography [ edit ] The Mexico\u2013U.S. border stretches from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the Gulf of Mexico in the east. Border states include the Mexican states of Baja California , Sonora , Chihuahua , Coahuila , Nuevo Le\u00f3n , and Tamaulipas and the U.S. states of California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.

That\u2019s fantastic. So, it\u2019s a great \u2014 it\u2019s a great feeling to have closed up the border. Now people come in if they come in through merit, if they come in legally \u2014 but they don\u2019t come in like they used to. And human trafficking is \u2014 I think we\u2019re down 96 percent or something. It\u2019s been incredible. Mark, why don\u2019t you say a few words, please. ACTING COMMISSIONER MORGAN: Yes, sir. So, thank you. So first of all, what you see behind me has saved American lives. Every single bit of concrete and steel that goes into the ground, the operational capacity of the men and women you\u2019re seeing right here goes exponentially higher to stop dangerous things and people from coming into this country. Drugs \u2014 drugs alone \u2014 what this wall does is it helps us shape the behavior of the cartels. It puts us in an offensive position, just like the President said. Because of that, this year \u2014 year, to date \u2014 we\u2019ve seized over a million pounds of drugs. Think about that: this year, to date, a million pounds of drugs. And this wall is helping shape the behavior so that we can get better at doing that. We talked about criminals. We apprehend thousands of criminals every single year. Think about that. You know, a lot of these individuals are violent criminals. Because of this wall, we\u2019re able to apprehend and stop these criminals from coming into this country to repeat their offenses. So we have fewer victims of United States citizens because of the wall, because of what this President has provided us. Let\u2019s talk about gangs. Every single year, we stop hundreds and hundreds of gangs from pouring into this country \u2014 like MS-13, whose motto is \u201cRape, Kill, and Control.\u201d That\u2019s their motto: \u201cRape, Kill, and Control.\u201d Just recently \u2014 it wasn\u2019t that long ago \u2014 they used machetes to hack up their victims, and they actually leave them decapitated. That\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about when we\u2019re talking about what this tool provides us. And then, of course, illegal immigration: Even during the height of a global pandemic, illegal immigration continues. And they allow themselves to be put in stash houses that are unsanitary, unsafe. They\u2019re put in tractor trailers for days. I mean, there\u2019s COVID \u2014 that\u2019s like a COVID petri dish. But yet, they\u2019re coming across.\nthere have been more military operations at the border. The administration has also increased the number of expedited removals. Biden has tried to work with Congress to overhaul the immigration system, but a majority of Republican lawmakers have not moved forward with the Senate $118 billion border agreement . Claim 2: Biden\u2019s executive order has reduced illegal migration Unable to act more broadly without Congress, Biden has implemented a handful of policies aimed at reducing the number of crossings, and asylum claims, at the Southern border over the last few months. One June 4, Biden issued executive actions severely restricted asylum claims between ports of entry , blocking most unauthorized migrants from attaining asylum. The Biden administration has said that since the policy went into effect, there has been a 40% decrease in unauthorized crossings. But these types of dips are not surprising. Historically, these policies deter migrants for a short period of time, but those numbers tend to go up, according to an analysis by the D.C.-based Washington Office on Latin America. Migrants tend to go into a wait-and-see period before crossing again. Many migrants who have talked to NPR in Mexican border communities have said they will attempt to cross, despite the policies . Of note: Biden\u2019s asylum restrictions mirror those implemented by Trump, but that Biden lifted in 2021 . Claim 3: Migrants crossing are committing crimes There is no doubt that some migrants who have crossed the border without authorization have committed crimes. This has been something Republicans have been hammering on recently, after two Venezuelan immigrants were charged with capital murder for killing a 12-year-old girl. But data shows a vast majority of immigrants do not commit crimes. In fact, a study by Northwestern University examining a 150-year period found that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than people born in the U.S. Facebook Flipboard Email\nmade the claim and said, \u201cTo be clear, we never have and never will endorse Biden.\u201d But the union, which endorsed Trump in 2020, supported the proposed bipartisan border agreement that Biden backed and Trump opposed, NBC News reported in February. \u2013 Joedy McCreary Biden claim: Illegal border crossings dropped 40% after his June directive \u201cI've changed (the law) in a way that now you're in a situation where there are 40% fewer people coming across the border illegally.\u201d Biden took executive action on June 4 that authorized the U.S. to turn away migrants who enter the country illegally when crossing levels are high. The policy is triggered anytime unlawful crossings hit an average of 2,500 people a day in a given week. In remarks posted on June 26 , Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas said Border Patrol encounters along the U.S.-Mexico border had dropped by over 40% since Biden took action. However, immigration experts have cautioned that it\u2019s difficult to point to any one reason for a drop in crossings at the border, PolitiFact noted in its fact check on this claim . Immigration rights organizations have sued the Biden administration over the new asylum restrictions at the border. \u2013Andre Byik Trump claim: Everybody wanted Roe v. Wade overturned \u201cI put three great Supreme Court justices on the court, and they happened to vote in favor of killing Roe v. Wade and moving it back to the states. This is something that everybody wanted.\u201d This is not an accurate summary of public opinion on the question. Numerous polls show most Americans were not in favor of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in June 2022 . For example, a poll conducted by Pew Research Center in July 2022 found that 57% of respondents said they disapproved of the overturning of the landmark decision. Another PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll conducted in May 2022 (before the case was decided) found that 64% of respondents were opposed to reversing Roe v. Wade. There is little evidence opinions have changed much since the decision. A Marquette Law School poll conducted in February 2024 found that 67% of adults opposed the ruling, while a Gallup poll from June 2023 found that 60% of respondents said overturning Roe v. Wade was a \u201cbad thing.\u201d - Brad Sylvester Biden claim: Historians voted Trump \u2018worst\u2019 president in history \u201c(Trump) was the worst in all of American\nnow you're in a situation where there are 40 percent fewer people coming across the border illegally.\" Mostly True. The Department of Homeland Security announced that illegal immigration encounters dropped by 40 percent, to fewer than 2,400 each day , in the weeks after Biden announced a policy largely barring asylum access for people entering the U.S. at the southern border. The policy was announced June 4. But immigration experts caution that it's difficult to pinpoint a single reason for any change in border crossings. For example, other factors, such as hot weather , can affect migration patterns. Since the policy was announced only a few weeks ago, it's unclear whether the drop in illegal immigration will continue . Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, associate policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, told PolitiFact the policy could have a short-term deterrent effect. But Adam Isacson, defense oversight director at the Washington Office on Latin America told PolitiFact, that no crackdown in the past decade has had a lasting impact . Trump's falsehoods about his and Biden's economic achievements Trump: \"I gave you the largest tax cut in history.\" False. When it was passed in 2017, Trump's tax cut was, in inflation-adjusted dollars, the fourth-largest since 1940. And as a percentage of gross domestic product, it ranked seventh in history, according to figures published by the Treasury Department. Trump: \"The only jobs (Biden) created are for illegal immigrants and bounceback jobs, bounce back from the COVID.\" False. Since Biden took office in early 2021, the number of foreign-born Americans who are employed has risen by about 5.6 million. But over the same time period, the number of native-born Americans employed has increased by almost 7.4 million. (There are many more native-born Americans than foreign-born Americans, so on a percentage basis, the increase for foreign-born Americans is about 22 percent, compared with 6 percent for native-born Americans.) It's also wrong to say that all the foreign-born employment gains (much less all the employment gains, period) stem from migrants here illegally. The data for foreign-born Americans includes anyone born outside the U.S., including immigrants who have been in the United States legally for decades. Employment on Biden's watch passed its prepandemic level by June 2022, about a year-and-a-half into his term. Since then, the U.S. economy has created an additional 6.2 million jobs.

Instead, the focus seems to be on the aftermath of the 2020 election, where claims of widespread voter fraud were made by Trump and his supporters, not the Democrats.\n\n4. **Democratic Actions**: While there have been various investigations and discussions surrounding the legitimacy of the 2020 election results, these actions are primarily reactions to the claims made by Trump and his allies rather than an active attempt by the Democratic Party to overturn the results. The Democratic Party has generally focused on affirming the election results and ensuring the integrity of future elections.\n\n5. **Political Narrative**: The statement may reflect a political narrative rather than an objective fact. The claim that the Democratic Party has been trying to \"overturn\" the election results is subjective and can be interpreted differently based on political perspectives.\n\nIn summary, the knowledge provided does not support the assertion that the Democratic Party has spent the last three and a half years trying to overturn the results of the last election.

President Barack Obama , a Democrat and former U.S. senator from Illinois , was ineligible to seek reelection to a third term due to the restrictions of the American presidential term limits established by the Twenty-second Amendment . [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Both the Democratic and Republican parties, as well as third parties such as the Green and Libertarian parties, held a series of presidential primary elections and caucuses that took place between February and June 2016, staggered among the 50 states, the District of Columbia , and U.S. territories . This nominating process was also an indirect election, where voters cast ballots for a slate of delegates to a political party's nominating convention , who in turn elected their party's presidential nominee. Speculation about the 2016 campaign began almost immediately following the 2012 campaign, with New York magazine declaring that the race had begun in an article published on November 8, two days after the 2012 election. [ 38 ] On the same day, Politico released an article predicting that the 2016 general election would be between Clinton and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush , while an article in The New York Times named New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Senator Cory Booker from New Jersey as potential candidates. [ 39 ] [ 40 ] Nominations Republican Party Primaries Main article: 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries With seventeen major candidates entering the race, starting with Ted Cruz on March 23, 2015, this was the largest presidential primary field for any political party in American history, [ 41 ] before being overtaken by the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries. [ 42 ] Prior to the Iowa caucuses on February 1, 2016, Perry, Walker, Jindal, Graham, and Pataki withdrew due to low polling numbers. Despite leading many polls in Iowa, Trump came in second to Cruz, after which Huckabee, Paul, and Santorum withdrew due to poor performances at the ballot box. Following a sizable victory for Trump in the New Hampshire primary , Christie, Fiorina, and Gilmore abandoned\nof weeks later, Trump said that he \u201cgenerally speaking would not\u201d use the Comstock Act to outlaw the shipment of abortion pills.

Salman Ghazi, managing director of Iqra Education Foundation, which provides religious curriculum to nearly 200 regular schools run by Muslim managements, said that the low participation of Muslims in higher education has its roots in the partition of the country. \"There was discrimination against Muslims in the aftermath. The tendency among young men was that higher education was a waste of time and money because they faced odds while aspiring for government jobs,\" said Ghazi. However, a Maharashtra cadre officer from the 1979 IAS batch said that low participation of Muslims in the exams, rather than discrimination, was the cause for their low representation in the services. \"As a Muslim, I never faced discrimination. Muslims were around 3.5% of the successful candidates at that time. I do not know whether it is true today, but the percentage of Muslim candidates was lower. However, the success rate for Muslims was higher. If there was discrimination, this would not be the case,\" said the former bureaucrat. There is also a consensus that the community was turning to higher education in larger numbers. \"Globalisation has reduced religious discrimination, and there are many Muslims in the corporate world in India. I think there has been a paradigm shift in the attitude to higher education. Wealthy Muslims are establishing schools. Even the Ulema - the clergy - is promoting schools rather than madrassas.

After the result was declared, many students came forward saying that there are discrepancies in the evaluation process. One student also filed a petition in the Bombay High Court after receiving zero marks in the NEET 2020 exams, even though while checking her OMR sheet, she had calculated herself getting at least 600 out of 720 marks. Another student has pointed out that as per the scanned OMR sheet uploaded by NTA, he has scored a perfect 720 out of 720, but according to the final scorecard, he scored a mere 212 in the NEET 2020 exams, which is highly unlikely. This year, the NEET 2020 exam result was released on October 16 and two students ended up scoring full marks i.e. 720 out of 720 in the medical entrance examination.

The primary goal was to provide financial and technical assistance to developing countries for development projects. Key figures in its establishment included U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau and economist John Maynard Keynes, among others.\n\n2. **Founding of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)**: The IMF was also established at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944, with similar goals of promoting international monetary cooperation and financial stability. Like the World Bank, it was founded by a group of nations and key economic figures, particularly from the United States and Europe.\n\n3. **Ferdinand Marcos**: Ferdinand Marcos was the President of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986. He did not have any role in the founding of the World Bank or the IMF, as these institutions were created long before his presidency.\n\n4. **Dr. Jose Rizal**: Dr. Jose Rizal was a Filipino nationalist and revolutionary figure, known for his role in advocating for reform in the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period. He was executed in 1896, which is well before the creation of both the World Bank and the IMF.\n\nBased on this analysis, it is clear that neither Ferdinand Marcos nor Dr. Jose Rizal had any involvement in the establishment of the World Bank or the IMF.

She was the first woman to hold both positions. During her first tenure as Finance Minister in the administration of President Olusegun Obasanjo , she spearheaded negotiations with the Paris Club that led to the elimination of US$30 billion of Nigeria's debt, including the outright cancellation of US$18 billion.

This implies a formal religious requirement for NASA missions.\n\n2. **Key Points from the Knowledge**: \n   - NASA is a scientific organization that operates based on principles of science, technology, and engineering.\n   - While NASA may engage with various religious groups and individuals, including the Pope, there is no formal requirement or tradition that mandates receiving blessings from the Pope for every space mission.\n   - The concept of seeking God's permission is a religious belief and not a procedural step in NASA\u2019s mission planning or execution.\n\n3. **Reasoning**:\n   - The claim that NASA \"always\" receives blessings from the Pope is overly broad and not supported by evidence. There might be instances where religious leaders have offered blessings, but this is not a consistent or required practice.\n   - The assertion that God's permission must be sought before a space mission does not align with NASA's operational framework, which is based on scientific methods rather than religious mandates.\n\nGiven this analysis, the statement is inaccurate as it presents an unfounded requirement that does not reflect how NASA operates or its relationship with religious institutions.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 0, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.0}
{"claim": "Joe Biden is for open borders, sanctuary cities, free lawyers and health care for illegal immigrants.", "label": "Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking", "result": {"response": "To assess the factual accuracy of the statement \"Joe Biden is for open borders, sanctuary cities, free lawyers and health care for illegal immigrants,\" we need to analyze each component of the claim against the provided knowledge points.\n\n1. **Open Borders**: The knowledge points indicate that Trump claimed Biden \"allowed millions of unauthorized migrants to enter the country,\" but it clarifies that while unauthorized crossings have hit record highs, the border is not \"open.\" In fact, the federal government has reinforced the border and increased military operations. Therefore, the claim that Biden supports \"open borders\" is misleading.\n\n2. **Sanctuary Cities**: The knowledge does not directly address the concept of sanctuary cities in relation to Biden's policies. However, sanctuary cities are typically defined as jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. Biden has not explicitly endorsed the idea of sanctuary cities but has focused on reforming the immigration system.\n\n3. **Free Lawyers for Illegal Immigrants**: The knowledge points do not provide specific information regarding Biden's stance on providing free legal representation for illegal immigrants. Therefore, this claim is not verifiable based on the provided knowledge.\n\n4. **Health Care for Illegal Immigrants**: The knowledge indicates that Biden and other Democratic candidates have expressed that they would support health care coverage for undocumented immigrants, but it does not state that this coverage would be free. The claim that he supports \"free health care\" for illegal immigrants is misleading, as it suggests that there would be no cost involved, which is not supported by the knowledge.\n\nIn summary, the statement combines various claims about Biden's immigration policies, some of which are misleading or not supported by the available evidence.

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, the presumptive presidential nominees, shared a debate stage June 27 for the first time since 2020, in a feisty confrontation that \u2014 thanks to debate rules \u2014 managed to avoid the near-constant interruptions that marred their previous meetings. CNN hosted the debate , which had no audience, at its Atlanta studio. CNN anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash moderated. The debate format allowed CNN to mute candidates' microphones when it wasn't their turn to speak. READ MORE: 3 key moments from CNN's Biden-Trump debate Trump attacked Biden's record, blaming inflation and other issues on Biden's \"insane and stupid policies.\" Biden questioned Trump's conduct, noting that Trump is a convicted felon and saying he has the \"morals of an alley cat.\" Biden and Trump clashed on topics including immigration, the economy, abortion and their ages. Trump's outlandish immigration claim Trump says Biden \"allowed millions of people to come in here from prisons, jails and mental institutions.\" Pants on Fire! Immigration officials arrested about 103,700 noncitizens with criminal convictions (whether in the U.S. or abroad) from fiscal years 2021 to 2024, federal data shows. That accounts for people stopped at and between ports of entry. Not everyone was let in. The term \"noncitizens\" includes people who may have had legal immigration status in the U.S. but were not U.S. citizens. The data reflects the people that the federal government knows about, but it's inexhaustive. However, immigration experts said despite the data's limitations, there is no evidence to support Trump's statement. Biden's close to the mark about immigration reductions Biden: \"I've changed (the law) in the way that now you're in a situation where there are 40 percent fewer people coming across the border illegally.\" Mostly True.

June 28, 2024 5:00 AM ET Sergio Mart\u00ednez-Beltr\u00e1n Guests at the Old Town Pour House watch a debate between President Biden and former President Donald Trump on Thursday in Chicago. The debate is the first of two scheduled between the two candidates before the November election. Scott Olson/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Scott Olson/Getty Images Without a doubt, the issue of immigration is playing a big role in the 2024 presidential campaign \u2014 and it was certainly one of the main points of contention between President Biden and former President Donald Trump in Thursday night's debate. Trump accused Biden of allowing millions of unauthorized migrants to enter the country. He also said many falsehoods about the current state of immigration. 4 takeaways from the first presidential debate Meanwhile, Biden attempted to explain what he would do to continue lowering the number of migrants crossing illegally, despite that number hitting an all-time high during his tenure. Here are three fact checks of claims made during the debate related to immigration: Claim 1: The U.S. Southern border is open This is a talking point used often by Republicans when referring to Biden\u2019s handling of the U.S.-Mexico border. \u201cHe decided to open up our border, open up our country,\u201d Trump said of Biden during the debate. But this is not accurate. It is true that under Biden, unauthorized crossings hit a record high, oftentimes overwhelming certain border communities and straining its resources . But the border is not \"open.\" In fact, it is arguably more reinforced than ever. The federal government has added more sections of the U.S. Southern border walls, and there have been more military operations at the border. The administration has also increased the number of expedited removals. Biden has tried to work with Congress to overhaul the immigration system, but a majority of Republican lawmakers have not moved forward with the Senate $118 billion border agreement . Claim\nDemocrats Say Health Plans Would Cover Undocumented Immigrants - YouTube About Press Copyright Contact us Creator Advertise Developers Terms Privacy Policy & Safety How YouTube works Test new features \u00a9 2026 Google LLC\nButtigieg to support his affirmative answer. Buttigieg : \"Our country is healthier when everybody is healthier. And remember, we\u2019re talking about something people are getting a \u2014 given a chance to buy into. In the same way that there are undocumented immigrants in my community who pay, they pay sales taxes, they pay property taxes directly or indirectly. This is not about a handout. This is an insurance program. And we do ourselves no favor by having 11 million undocumented people in our country be unable to access health care.\" Guthrie then asked Biden to comment. Biden : \"You cannot let \u2014 as the mayor said, you cannot let people who are sick, no matter where they come from, no matter what their status, go uncovered. You can\u2019t do that. It\u2019s just going to be taken care of, period. You have to. It\u2019s the humane thing to do. \"But here\u2019s the deal. The deal is that he\u2019s right about three things. Number one, they in fact contribute to the well-being of the country, but they also \u2014 for example, they\u2019ve increased the lifespan of Social Security because they\u2019re \u2014 they have a job. They\u2019re paying the Social Security tax. That\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s increased the lifespan. They would do the same thing in terms of reducing the overall cost of health care by them being able to be treated and not wait until they\u2019re in extremis.\" No other candidate commented on that question. So all candidates raised their hands affirming they\u2019d have a plan that would offer coverage for immigrants in the country illegally. But the question did not directly ask if coverage would be free. Buttigieg specifically said people would buy the coverage, and that it was \"not about a handout.\" Biden in his answer spoke about the contributions of immigrants in the country illegally \u2014 and said that if they had health care coverage, they\u2019d be reducing the cost of the overall health care system. Our ruling A Trump re-election campaign ad said Democratic presidential candidates \"support giving illegal immigrants free healthcare at our expense.\" This is misleading. The claim is based on a raise-your-hand type of question in a June debate. Candidates were asked if their health care plans would provide coverage for immigrants in the country illegally. All candidates raised their hand. But the question did not ask if the coverage would be for free.\nAP FACT CHECK: Examining claims from the last Trump-Biden debate | PBS News Support PBS News Your generous monthly contribution\u2014 or whatever you can give\u2014will help secure our future.

President Donald Trump's first line of the night, about COVID-19 deaths, was false and set the tone as he and Democratic rival Joe Biden unleashed a torrent of claims in their last presidential debate . Trump misrepresented the reality of the pandemic in myriad and familiar ways, insisting against obvious reality that the pandemic is drawing to a close. He also boasted about \"clean\" facilities at the border for migrant children, ignoring the filthy conditions under which they were held in 2018. Biden, at times, was selective on the coronavirus and other matters, at one point stating that no one under Obamacare lost private health coverage. Millions did. A look at how some of the statements on the stage in Nashville, Tennessee, compared with the facts: CORONAVIRUS TRUMP: \"We're rounding the turn. We're rounding the corner. It's going away.\" THE FACTS: No, the coronavirus isn't going away. It's coming back. New cases are on the rise toward their summer peak. Deaths have also been increasing. According to data through Oct. 21 from Johns Hopkins University, the seven-day rolling average for daily new cases in the U.S. rose over the past two weeks from over 42,300 on Oct. 7 to nearly 60,000 on Oct. 21. In that time the seven-day rolling average for daily new deaths in the U.S. rose from 695 to 757. ___ TRUMP: \"All he does is talk about shutdowns. But forget about him.

However, they also note that common mask materials have pore sizes that are larger than the size of many aerosolized particles, including those from respiratory viruses.\n\n2. **Particle Size**: The knowledge points mention that SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly spread by aerosols that are much smaller than droplets and that these aerosols can pass through common mask materials. This suggests that while masks may provide some level of protection against larger particles, they are less effective against smaller aerosolized particles.\n\n3. **Wildfire Smoke**: The statement specifically refers to wildfire smoke, which contains fine particulate matter (PM2.5) that is significantly smaller than the pore sizes of most ordinary masks. The knowledge does not explicitly cover wildfire smoke but implies that if common masks are ineffective against smaller particles from respiratory viruses, they are likely also ineffective against fine particulate matter from smoke.\n\n4. **CDC Guidance**: The knowledge does not provide a direct quote or specific reference to a CDC announcement regarding ordinary masks and wildfire smoke. However, the implication of the provided information aligns with the idea that ordinary masks may not adequately filter out small particles, such as those found in wildfire smoke.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the statement that \"CDC announces that ordinary (non-N95) masks (which most people are wearing) will do nothing to protect you against wildfire smoke because they do not catch small particles\" appears to be accurate, as the knowledge supports the idea that ordinary masks are ineffective against small particles.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"True\"\n}\n```", "answer": "True"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "Efficacy of masks and face coverings in controlling outward aerosol particle emission from expiratory activities | Scientific Reports Skip to main content Thank you for visiting nature.com.

Efficacy of masks and face coverings in controlling outward aerosol particle emission from expiratory activities Download PDF Download PDF Subjects Disease prevention Infectious diseases Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a surge in demand for facemasks to protect against disease transmission. In response to shortages, many public health authorities have recommended homemade masks as acceptable alternatives to surgical masks and N95 respirators. Although mask wearing is intended, in part, to protect others from exhaled, virus-containing particles, few studies have examined particle emission by mask-wearers into the surrounding air. Here, we measured outward emissions of micron-scale aerosol particles by healthy humans performing various expiratory activities while wearing different types of medical-grade or homemade masks. Both surgical masks and unvented KN95 respirators, even without fit-testing, reduce the outward particle emission rates by 90% and 74% on average during speaking and coughing, respectively, compared to wearing no mask, corroborating their effectiveness at reducing outward emission. These masks similarly decreased the outward particle emission of a coughing superemitter, who for unclear reasons emitted up to two orders of magnitude more expiratory particles via coughing than average. In contrast, shedding of non-expiratory micron-scale particulates from friable cellulosic fibers in homemade cotton-fabric masks confounded explicit determination of their efficacy at reducing expiratory particle emission. Audio analysis of the speech and coughing intensity confirmed that people speak more loudly, but do not cough more loudly, when wearing a mask. Further work is needed to establish the efficacy of cloth masks at blocking expiratory particles for speech and coughing at varied intensity and to assess whether virus-contaminated fabrics can generate aerosolized fomites, but the results strongly corroborate the efficacy of medical-grade masks and highlight the importance of regular washing of homemade masks.

These aerosols are carried in the flow of air as someone breathes, and are significantly smaller than the pore / perforation size of common mask materials. All common types of masks also suffer from leakage through gaps around the edges, rendering them ineffective. Any higher grade mask (really designed for specialist industrial applications) that is not professionally fitted will also likely be ineffective due to leakage. The world-wide data that is now available from places where mask mandates were imposed consistently shows no measurable effect on infection spread. Added to that, inappropriate use of various computer modelling methods has resulted in misleading evidence being used to promote the efficacy of masks in preventing transmission, which they simply do not do.\u201d Co-chair Graham Stringer MP said : \u201cThe new Prime Minister and Health Secretary should not impose mask wearing again unless they can produce high quality evidence that the benefits far outweigh the harms to the individual and society as a whole. Our APPG has heard from experts that this evidence does not appear to exist and so policy makers should not be reintroducing such measures on a \u2018just in case\u2019 basis. Individuals have always been, and continue to be, free to wear a mask should they so choose, and it should remain an individual choice.\u201d View the full minutes for this meeting, held on Monday 17 October 2022.
