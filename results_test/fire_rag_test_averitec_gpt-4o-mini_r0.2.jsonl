The skepticism expressed by Richard Greene and others does not equate to factual evidence that the test result was inaccurate.\n\n2. **False Positive Claims**: The knowledge does not mention any verified instances or evidence of Trump's positive test being a false positive. It discusses the context of skepticism but does not substantiate the claim that the test result was incorrect.\n\n3. **Poisoning Claim**: The statement introduces a hypothetical scenario about an adversary poisoning Trump\u2019s soda and claiming he suffered from COVID-19. This is a speculative and unfounded assertion that is not supported by any evidence in the knowledge provided. There is no mention of any credible threat or incident related to poisoning in the context of Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis.\n\n4. **General Context**: The knowledge discusses the political implications and public reactions to Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis but does not support the specific claims made in the statement regarding false positives or poisoning.\n\nBased on the above points, the statement lacks factual support and introduces unfounded speculation.

On Oct. 2, author and former attorney Richard Greene posted his speculations on Facebook, suggesting Trump's positive test result could be a \"con.\" Greene also wrote a 2016 Huffington Post story : \"Is Donald Trump Mentally Ill? 3 Professors Of Psychiatry Ask President Obama To Conduct \u2018A Full Medical And Neuropsychiatric Evaluation.\u2019\" His post soon went viral. There are three reasons, according to Greene, not to trust the White House's announcement that Trump tested positive: Trump was on his way to losing his reelection bid after his performance during the first presidential debate on Sept. 29. Testing positive for COVID-19 redirected attention away from the topic of white supremacists. By \"sailing through\" a fake illness, Trump could prove his mettle to supporters and emulate Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Greene doesn't trust \"anything that comes out of (Trump's) mouth, or his 'Twitter thumbs.'\" Greene did not mention first lady Melania Trump's positive test result in his post. \"My FB post on it was instantaneous and has received more, and quicker, response ... and more positive response ... than anything I believe I have ever posted,\" Greene told USA TODAY in an email. Greene attributed his skepticism to \"severe cynicism\" after untruths told by Trump during his presidency, as well as a \"Coronavirus October Surprise.\" Trump has made more than 20,000 false or misleading claims during his term, according to a July report by The Washington Post's Fact Checker. \"The term 'October Surprise' was coined by a 1980s political operative but has ever since been appropriated by the media to describe unexpected political disasters in the twilight hours of the campaign,\" the Smithsonian Magazine explained , adding \"they\u2019ve become a staple of modern politics.\" In Greene's view, an \"October surprise\" is one of \"12 Ways Donald Trump Can Win,\" a list compiled by Greene in an Aug. 23 Medium blog post .

But President Donald Trump falsely claimed \u201c99%\u201d of cases \u201care totally harmless.\u201d The president, according to his press secretary, was referring to the case fatality rate, and he claimed the amount of testing the U.S. has conducted showed this. The testing actually shows a case fatality rate of 4.5% , but not everyone who has contracted COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, has been tested. Some estimates say the fatality rate among those infected is likely around 1%. Asked whether cases that don\u2019t result in death are \u201charmless,\u201d White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said : \u201cThe president was noting the fact that the vast majority of Americans who contract coronavirus will come out on the other side of this.\u201d \u201cSome estimates do place the mortality at about 1%,\u201d Columbia University epidemiologist Stephen Morse told us in an email, noting that we don\u2019t have a solid figure for the total number of people who have been infected. \u201cHowever, 1% mortality is not the same as \u201899% \u2026 totally harmless\u2019. I wish that were true. \u2018Totally harmless\u2019 suggests that the infection doesn\u2019t do any harm.\u201d In addition to patients who get sick enough to need hospitalization, some who have recovered from COVID-19 report experiencing long-term effects, \u201cincluding lung damage but also other symptoms, and we don\u2019t know how common these sequelae (the term for aftereffects of disease) are,\u201d Morse said. Trump made his claim in July 4 remarks at the White House. \u201cLikewise, testing \u2014 there were no tests for a new virus, but now we have tested almost 40 million people,\u201d he said . \u201cBy so doing, we show cases, 99% of which are totally harmless. Results that no other country can show, because no other country has testing that we have \u2014 not in terms of the numbers or in terms of the quality.\u201d The president exaggerated the number of tests a bit: 36.3 million had been conducted as of July 3, according to the CDC. The COVID Tracking Project had the total at 34.9 million as of July 4. What those tests show\ncampaign,\" the Smithsonian Magazine explained , adding \"they\u2019ve become a staple of modern politics.\" In Greene's view, an \"October surprise\" is one of \"12 Ways Donald Trump Can Win,\" a list compiled by Greene in an Aug. 23 Medium blog post . Greene theorized Trump would persuade the Food and Drug Administration to approve a vaccine that \"cures\" COVID-19 this month, effectively ending \"The Coronavirus Crisis.\" \"This could be another version of that 'October Surprise' strategy,\" Greene said. USA TODAY reached out to the Trump campaign for comment. Trump adviser Hope Hicks, others tested positive for COVID-19 Despite skepticism by some on social media, the president could have been exposed to the coronavirus during any number of events over the past few weeks. News of the president and first lady's positive test results came after reports that White House adviser Hope Hicks tested positive, according to USA TODAY . Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity on Thursday that he and the first lady \"spend a lot of time with Hope.\" Hicks traveled extensively with Trump over the last week, including to the first 2020 presidential debate in Cleveland on Sept. 29. USA TODAY reported in-person attendees on Trump's side of the auditorium refused to wear masks. Debate moderator said a safety personnel member from the Cleveland Clinic offered masks to Trump's family, but he was \"waved away,\" according to USA TODAY . Hicks was one of 180 attendees to watch Trump announce the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court in the White House Rose Garden last week. USA TODAY reported that fewer than a third of those at the announcement wore masks. During an interview on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" on Friday, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who helped Trump prepare for the debate, said the president and others in the room were not wearing masks during preparations. \"No one was wearing masks in the room when we were prepping the president during that period of time. And the group was about five or six people, in total,\" Christie said, according to USA TODAY . Wearing a mask as well as social distancing from others by at least 6 feet are recommended steps for preventing the spread of COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition to Hicks , a number of other people around the president or who were at\nacting chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers Tomas Philipson had a mild case of COVID-19 in June but has since left his position at the White House. Top spokesperson for Vice President Mike Pence, Katie Miller, tested positive in early May. Miller returned to work. Pence confirmed he and wife Karen tested negative for the virus Friday morning, according to USA TODAY . Other members of the White House staff who work close to the president and family also tested positive in recent months. The list includes cafeteria workers, a White House valet, a Marine One helicopter pilot and a staffer for Pence, USA TODAY reported. Trump imitating Bolsonaro? On Friday, Greene retweeted a Financial Times video about how President Bolsonaro benefitted from his COVID-19 diagnosis. USA TODAY reported the Brazilian leader tested positive in July. \"The former army captain has repeatedly downplayed the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, often joined in rallies without wearing a mask\" the video says. \"Following in the footsteps of his political soulmate U.S. President Donald Trump, Bolsonaro also said he was taking the anti-Malaria drug hydroxychloroquine.\" Trump once touted hydroxychloroquine as a preventative drug for COVID-19, despite evidence showing it does not prevent the development of the disease, USA TODAY reported . Critics said Bolsonaro denied science by pitching the controversial drug as a possible solution. But returning to work after his quick recovery from COVID-19 made him seem like a \"messiah,\" according to the video. \"Assuming he truly recovered from the virus, he may emerge politically stronger from the pandemic,\" said Financial Times Brazil correspondent Andres Schipani. \"His approval ratings remain at roughly 30%, and they're already showing signs of improvement. With these numbers, history suggests he would be able to fend off efforts to eject him from office by impeachment procedures.\" Trump infamously said testing for the coronavirus is a double-edged sword and blamed a high number of U.S. cases on increased testing, according to USA TODAY . There are obvious similarities between Trump's and Bolsonaro's responses to the COVID-19 epidemic. But there is no proof that Trump planned to contract the disease or is lying about testing positive. Greene told USA TODAY the president's test result could be accurate, considering the number of people he is exposed to, but added \"It is doubtful we will EVER know.\" \"How can we trust ANYONE in Trump's loyal orbit(?) Remember when\nis he in the hospital out of precaution? Or is he in the hospital suffering from a life-threatening disease and is, in fact, leaving for political purposes? Political discourse is always a mixture of discrete facts, including the historical facts we choose to remember or forget, and the narratives which imbue them with hope, despair, anxiety, caution or God knows what else. That makes it very, very problematic, from the point of view of absolute versions of the truth. President Donald Trump posed for photos days after testing positive for COVID-19. Berkeley professor Martin Jay said photo ops like this are the president\u2019s way of framing a narrative that he is not in real medical danger. (White House Photo by Tia Dufour) Politics is precisely a space where our interests, our opinions, our values, our prejudices, our hopes for the future play an extraordinarily important role. When it comes to the truth, we\u2019re not simply disinterested scientists looking at it from afar far: We\u2019re in the middle of it all. That\u2019s why, inevitably, I think there\u2019ll always be a kind of spin or attempt to reframe the narrative. What\u2019s made it more problematic now is the exacerbation of the lack of trust that some people have with this administration, or the so-called \u2018lamestream media.\u2019 We have a politics where people don\u2019t just distrust their adversaries, but despise them. They are seen as enemies, and not just as competitors who can still be honored, even if we disagree with them. While there are people on the left who are, alas, gleeful about Trump\u2019s illness, there\u2019d certainly be people on Trump\u2019s side who would be jumping for joy if Joe Biden had a stroke in the middle of that last debate. I don\u2019t think this is new in politics, but those tendencies have dangerously increased. The capacity for people to truly listen to each other has diminished, because you\u2019re not listening to be persuaded, you\u2019re not listening to learn, you\u2019re not listening to compromise: You\u2019re listening to find ways to defeat or manipulate the enemy.

However, it emphasizes that each ballot must correspond to a registered voter, and there are mechanisms (like bar codes) in place to track ballots to ensure they are not duplicated.\n\n2. **Voting More than Once**: The knowledge hints at the existence of penalties for voting more than once in an election, which suggests that such actions are illegal and monitored.\n\n3. **State Regulations**: The knowledge also implies that voting regulations can vary by state, and it raises the question of whether voting in different states on different days is permissible. However, it does not provide a definitive answer regarding the legality of voting multiple times.\n\nGiven these points, the statement claims that a man voted four times after receiving four ballot applications. This raises several issues:\n\n- If the ballots were from different states, it might be possible for him to vote multiple times, but this would likely be illegal.\n- The knowledge suggests that there are systems in place to prevent multiple votes from the same individual, indicating that it is unlikely he could successfully cast four valid votes without detection.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the statement appears to be misleading or false, as it implies that a person could legally vote multiple times without consequences, which contradicts the information about penalties for such actions.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "It is possible.

However, if this is a misrepresentation or exaggeration, the statement would be false.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of corroborating evidence in the knowledge provided and the serious nature of the claims, it is reasonable to conclude that the statement is likely false or at least misleading.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 0, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.2}

This implies that the nation has been independent for 60 years, and during 29 of those years, it was governed by military leaders or regimes.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Knowledge Points**: The knowledge points do not provide specific details about the history of the nation in question, such as the timeline of military rule or the total years of independence. However, we can infer that the statement is likely referring to a country with a history of military coups or authoritarian regimes.\n\n3. **Historical Context**: To verify the statement, we would typically look at the historical timeline of the nation\u2019s governance. If the nation has indeed experienced military rule for 29 years out of a total of 60 years since its independence, then the statement would be true. If the actual years of military rule are less than 29, or if the total years of independence are different from 60, then the statement would be false.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Without specific historical data provided in the knowledge points, we cannot definitively confirm or deny the accuracy of the statement. However, if we assume that the statement is based on a commonly accepted historical narrative of a nation known for military governance, it could be plausible.\n\nGiven the lack of specific data to contradict the statement, I will conclude that the statement is likely true based on the context of nations with similar histories.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"True\"\n}\n```", "answer": "True"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 0, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.2}

As a result, 57 million Nigerians lack safe water, over 130 million lack adequate sanitation and the country has more than 10 million children out of school. 21.5% Another consequence of the mismanagement of the nation\u2019s resources is the high rate of unemployment, especially among the young. In 2016, between 12.1% and 21.5% of Nigeria\u2019s youth were without a job. Nigeria can close the inequality gap Nigeria is not a poor country yet millions are living in hunger. The government must work with the international community to get food and aid to hungry people now. But it can\u2019t stop there. It must free millions of Nigerians from poverty by building a new political and economic system that works for everyone, not just a fortunate few.

If you already submitted a mail-in or absentee ballot, you cannot vote at your polling place on Election Day. If you did not return your mail-in or absentee ballot and you want to vote in person, you have two options: Bring your ballot and the pre-addressed outer return envelope to your polling place to be voided. After you surrender your ballot and envelope and sign a declaration, you can then vote a regular ballot.

Keywords: Face masks, Carbon dioxide, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 1 INTRODUCTION Physical distancing, good hand hygiene and the wearing of gloves and face masks are among the most frequent measures taken to prevent person-to-person transmission of the virus (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 (Chu et al. , 2020; Howard et al. , 2020). Especially, the use of face masks in public reduces the spread of the virus by minimizing the excretion of respiratory droplets from asymptomatic infected individuals or individuals who have not yet developed symptoms (Bourouiba, 2020). The human body utilizes oxygen and generates carbon dioxide, which is then exhaled in the expiration air. An adult with healthy lungs produces approximately 5.6% by volume of CO 2 . When wearing a face mask, a fraction of carbon dioxide previously exhaled is inhaled again with each respiratory cycle. Some media have been claiming that carbon dioxide may slowly build up in the mask over time, causing medical issues related to the respiratory system such as hypercapnia (a condition arising from too much carbon dioxide in the blood). Only a few studies have been conducted so far in this field. In a study conducted by Sinkule et al. (2013), the breathing air quality when using N95 filtering facepiece respirators was assessed. The concentration of carbon dioxide increased to approximately 1.2\u20133% in a short period of light work. The participants did not show any obvious changes in physical functions. The average carbon dioxide concentration inhaled was, however, far higher than the limit of 0.1% of indoor carbon dioxide concentration in many countries. The study of Li et al. (2005) investigated the effects of wearing N95 and surgical face masks with and without nano-functional treatments on thermo-physiological responses and the subjective perception of discomfort in five healthy participants (men and women). They found that surgical face masks were rated significantly lower\nto send out 650 million masks, first targeting areas like Louisiana, Michigan, and New York, which at the time were experiencing particularly severe outbreaks of COVID-19. But the White House immediately put the kibosh on the idea when it caught wind of the plan, multiple Trump administration officials told The Post, with one official saying: \"There was concern from some in the White House Domestic Policy Council and the office of the vice president that households receiving masks might create concern or panic.\" \u2014Don Moynihan (@donmoyn) September 17, 2020 As of Thursday, over 6.6 million Americans had tested positive for COVID-19, and over 196,000 had died of the disease, according to The New York Times . In recent days, President Donald Trump has come under renewed scrutiny for his handling of the pandemic after the veteran journalist Bob Woodward released his latest book, \"Rage,\" which extensively documented Trump's response to the pandemic as it was unfolding. Woodward conducted 18 on-the-record interviews with Trump. In a tape from early February released by Woodward, Trump indicated he knew that the virus was airborne and could be more deadly than the seasonal flu, despite underplaying the risk in public . And in a subsequent tape from March, Trump acknowledged to Woodward that he deliberately downplayed the virus to avoid alarming the nation, even as significant community transmission was already occurring. \"I wanted to always play it down,\" Trump told Woodward in a tape from March 19 after he moved to restrict travel from Europe and declared a national emergency, as CNN noted . \"I still like playing it down because I don't want to create a panic.\" Read the full story at The Washington Post>> President Donald Trump Face masks coronavirus More Pandemic USPS Read next Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know HOME Subscribe This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers.

This new virus was first identified in the city of Wuhan in the Hubei province 1 . Since then, it has spread to over 203 countries, and was officially declared as a global pandemic illness by the World Health Organization (WHO) 2 . After almost 2 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has left a toll of 446 million infected and more than 6.0 million deaths worldwide 3 . From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of facemasks (FMs) has been controversial due to political, cultural and economic causes. However, multiple studies have highlighted the efficiency of FM in the reduction of COVID-19 transmission (i.e., from 6 to 80%) 4 . In another report the use of medical/surgical masks reduced the transmission rates by 85% 5 . Countries worldwide have adapted many different approaches to control the disease 6 . Non-pharmaceutical actions included the use gowns, gloves, and FM, all of which have been proven to be effective and more recently, the use of vaccines such as the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine, Curevac, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Sino pharm has proven effective in the control of the pandemic 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 . Some side effects associated with the use of FMs have been reported. The most common side effect described by healthcare workers was bilateral headaches (affecting up to 80% of users), dermatitis, itchy rash and elevated heart rates 11 . However, the WHO has advised populations to wear FMs on a large scale only excluding patients with limited respiratory conditions 4 . Recently updated guidelines issued by the WHO advised the use of FMs as part of its prevention recommendations which also included hand hygiene, physical distance of at least 1 m, avoidance of face touching and adequate indoor ventilation 2 , 12 . Previous clinical studies have addressed the potential impact of FMs on brain and cognitive functions 13 , 14 . One study in healthy young people showed that the 150-min use of surgical mask had no significant mental fatigue perception 13 while another showed that the prolonged use of FMs can result in headache and impaired\nMATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Tested Face Masks Three different types of face masks were tested: A medical face mask (also known as a surgical mask) conform with the European Union\u2019s health and safety standards (CE mark): This type of face mask is typically used by health care workers, ensuring a barrier that limits the transition of an infective agent between the hospital staff and the patient. During the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical face masks have been recommended as a means of source control for persons who are either symptomatic or asymptomatic to prevent the spread of respiratory droplets produced by coughing or sneezing. The application of medical masks as source control has been shown to decrease the release of respiratory droplets carrying respiratory viruses (Leung et al. , 2020) and they are recommended for the reduction of transmission of influenza (Cheng et al. , 2010; MacIntyre and Chughtai, 2015; MacIntyre et al. , 2015). Medical masks comply with requirements defined in European Standard EN 14683:2019 (European Committee for Standardization, 2019). KN95 with a one-way valve: N95 is an American standard managed by NIOSH, which is part of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). KN95 masks are the equivalent Chinese standard for masks. Both N95 and KN95 correspond to the FFP2 code used in the European Union (European Committee for Standardization, 2001) and protect against solid and liquid irritating aerosols with a minimum filter efficiency of 92%. The mask tested in this work included a one-way exhalation valve that makes it easier to breathe through. This type of mask is not recommended as an effective barrier against the SARS-CoV-2 virus because the valve releases unfiltered air when the wearer breathes out and therefore does not prevent the wearer from spreading the virus. It was included in the study to assess the potential impact of the exhalation valve on the concentration of accumulated carbon dioxide. Cloth masks: Since surgical and FFP2 masks were sometimes difficult to find at the beginning of the pandemic and, especially the FFP2 masks should be reserved for health care providers, cloth masks have become popular during the pandemic as they are cheap, easy to find or to make and can be washed and reused. Cloth masks can be made from common materials, such as sheets made of tightly woven cotton, and should include multiple layers of fabric. There are no standards or regulations for self-made cloth face masks.\nby A Freiberg \u00b7 2022 \u00b7 Cited by 1 \u2014 Two studies reported psychological symptoms like anxiety and stress as well as concentration and learning problems due to wearing a mask during the COVID-19 ..."}], "source": "rag_only"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 5, "concluded_by_rag": true, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.2}

The pandemic this year has raised concerns about large groups of voters gathering indoors, so some additional states \u2014 California, Nevada, New Jersey, Vermont plus Washington, D.C. \u2014 have decided to send ballots to all active voters. In other states, voters have to take action to request a mail ballot, though some of them took that step already if they live in a state that allows a permanent absentee voting list that may be offered to all voters, or only to certain voters based on specific criteria such as age or disability. We asked the Trump campaign to show how it arrived at 80 million unsolicited ballots, and whether that included a handful of states that have generally held all vote-by-mail elections for years. We did not receive a response. It\u2019s possible that Trump or an aide saw a prediction in an August New York Times article that \"80 million mail ballots will flood election offices this fall.\" However, that figure isn\u2019t limited to voters who will be sent \"unsolicited\" ballots. It includes voters who will have to request a mail ballot. The New York Times found that ballots will be mailed directly to about 44 million voters in nine states and D.C. So that\u2019s a little more than half of the figure Trump cited. WRAL partners with PolitiFact NC to fact check political stories University of Florida political scientist Michael McDonald found a similar total number of ballots \u2014 44.4 million \u2014 that will be sent in states conducting all-mail elections. He also counted Montana, where Gov. Steve Bullock used his emergency powers to allow counties to opt in to holding an all-mail election. As of late August, most Montana counties opted for all mail. Paul Gronke, an expert on voting by mail at Reed College, predicted somewhere north of 80 million ballots will be cast by mail, double 2016\u2019s total. In D.C. and the states that decided to send ballots to all voters this year due to the pandemic, many of those voters would have likely requested a ballot anyway or were on permanent absentee-ballot lists. For example, in California in 2016, there were 13 million ballots cast, including 7 million absentee. Gronke added up how many ballots were cast by absentee during the 2016 elections in California, Nevada, New Jersey and Vermont and concluded at most, 7.5 million\n80 million \u201cunsolicited\u201d mail-in ballots will not be sent to voters ahead of the 2020 presidential election.\nballots \u2014 more than 1.3% of the total \u2014 were rejected in the state's March primary for a variety of reasons, including missed deadlines. The lawsuit argues that mail-in ballots should have to be only postmarked \u2014 not received \u2014 by 7 p.m. on Election Day. Kirk Nielsen, one of 10 plaintiffs in the case, says the fate of a ballot is out of a voter's hands once it goes in the mail. His was one of thousands of ballots rejected in the state in 2018. Nielsen says he mailed it eight days before Election Day, but it was not received until eight days after. He worries about being disenfranchised again. 2020 Election: Secure Your Vote This November, Election Night Could Stretch Into Election Week Or Month \"I want to vote by mail this year because of the pandemic. I don't want to get sick at a crowded polling place and I don't want to contribute to spreading the virus by going to a crowded polling place, but that said, I think there's an even greater risk this year voting by mail that my mail ballot might not be counted, along with thousands of others,\" Nielsen says. His case is scheduled to be heard this month, but Republicans were heartened by the judge's refusal to issue a preliminary injunction against the state's mail-in rules. The judge said the Election Day receipt deadline \"eliminates the problem of missing, unclear, or even altered postmarks, eliminates delay that can have adverse consequences, and eliminates the remote possibility that in an extremely close election \u2014 Florida has had some \u2014 a person who did not vote on or before Election Day can fill out and submit a ballot later.\" These are all arguments that Republicans have made in defense of keeping the Election Day deadline currently in place in most states. 2020 Election: Secure Your Vote Chaos In Primary Elections Raises Fears For November \"Allowing massive amounts of ballots to arrive or the counting to continue well after Election Day really allows room for fraud,\" says Mandi Merritt, national press secretary for the Republican National Committee. \"It allows losing candidates or other partisan operatives to go find more late votes that could potentially change the legitimate outcome of an election and really just leaves room for unnecessary litigation.\" While Merritt did not offer an example, she says even the possibility of fraud would undermine\nanyway or were on permanent absentee-ballot lists. For example, in California in 2016, there were 13 million ballots cast, including 7 million absentee. Gronke added up how many ballots were cast by absentee during the 2016 elections in California, Nevada, New Jersey and Vermont and concluded at most, 7.5 million or so ballots will be sent in those states to voters who have not requested them. In the state that is holding the largest all-mail election \u2014 California \u2014 about two-thirds of the voters had registered to vote absentee even before the move to mail every voter a ballot, said Nate Persily, a Stanford law professor. Trump\u2019s use of the term \"unsolicited\" While Trump uses the terms \"unsolicited\" or \"unrequested\" ballots, states generally use other terms such as \"voting by mail.\" Some experts were critical of Trump\u2019s terms, noting that if residents don\u2019t want to receive a ballot, they don\u2019t have to register in the states that automatically send them. \"In an all-mail ballot state, voter registration is a mail-ballot request,\" McDonald said. MIT professor Charles Stewart said he personally wouldn\u2019t use the word \"unsolicited\" but thinks it\u2019s fair game in political discourse. \"As to \u2018unsolicited,\u2019 I think that\u2019s a fair, if loaded, term,\" he said. \"You don\u2019t have to ask for a ballot, and there are voters in those states who would prefer not to be mailed one.\" Trump\u2019s misleading comments about ballot harvesting Trump criticized the effort to send ballots unrequested, and said that voters who receive them are \"going to harvest.\" Ballot harvesting generally refers to someone collecting absentee ballots on behalf of others and then submitting them. Some voting rights experts see the unofficial term \"ballot harvesting\" as pejorative and prefer the term \"ballot collection.\" Many states allow at least certain individuals to collect some ballots on behalf of others, which can be helpful for voters with disabilities or those without cars. Our ethics policy for PolitiFact journalists There have been isolated cases of fraud associated with ballot harvesting, including in a North Carolina congressional race in 2018. But Trump is wrong to suggest that such fraud is rampant. Trump has repeatedly suggested that the increase in voting by mail will lead to fraud. But fraud is statistically rare, including in states that have relied on voting by mail for years.

Also in 2017, news reports surfaced that Hunter Biden was in a romantic relationship with Hallie Olivere Biden, Beau Biden\u2019s widow. Their relationship would end two years later. During this time Beau went through multiple periods of alcohol and drug binges followed by rehab efforts.

Legal troubles and pardon In 2020 Hunter Biden disclosed that the Justice Department has been investigating him since late 2018. The investigation was led by David C. Weiss, the U.S. attorney in Delaware, and involved potential criminal violations of tax and money-laundering laws. In June 2023 Hunter Biden agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor counts of failing to pay his 2016 and 2017 taxes on time. He also accepted conditions that would avoid his being prosecuted on a felony charge that he lied when he said he was sober when buying a handgun in 2018.

In August 2023 U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland announced that Weiss had been named the special counsel in charge of the investigation, and prosecutors filed court documents saying that they expected the Biden case to go to trial. In June 2024 Biden went on trial for the gun-related charges, and he was found guilty on all three counts later that month.

On Friday, Greene retweeted a Financial Times video about how President Bolsonaro benefitted from his COVID-19 diagnosis.

Critics said Bolsonaro denied science by pitching the controversial drug as a possible solution. But returning to work after his quick recovery from COVID-19 made him seem like a \"messiah,\" according to the video. \"Assuming he truly recovered from the virus, he may emerge politically stronger from the pandemic,\" said Financial Times Brazil correspondent Andres Schipani. \"His approval ratings remain at roughly 30%, and they're already showing signs of improvement. With these numbers, history suggests he would be able to fend off efforts to eject him from office by impeachment procedures.\" Trump infamously said testing for the coronavirus is a double-edged sword and blamed a high number of U.S. cases on increased testing, according to USA TODAY . There are obvious similarities between Trump's and Bolsonaro's responses to the COVID-19 epidemic. But there is no proof that Trump planned to contract the disease or is lying about testing positive. Greene told USA TODAY the president's test result could be accurate, considering the number of people he is exposed to, but added \"It is doubtful we will EVER know.\" \"How can we trust ANYONE in Trump's loyal orbit(?)

Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity on Thursday that he and the first lady \"spend a lot of time with Hope.\" Hicks traveled extensively with Trump over the last week, including to the first 2020 presidential debate in Cleveland on Sept. 29. USA TODAY reported in-person attendees on Trump's side of the auditorium refused to wear masks. Debate moderator said a safety personnel member from the Cleveland Clinic offered masks to Trump's family, but he was \"waved away,\" according to USA TODAY . Hicks was one of 180 attendees to watch Trump announce the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court in the White House Rose Garden last week. USA TODAY reported that fewer than a third of those at the announcement wore masks. During an interview on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" on Friday, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who helped Trump prepare for the debate, said the president and others in the room were not wearing masks during preparations. \"No one was wearing masks in the room when we were prepping the president during that period of time. And the group was about five or six people, in total,\" Christie said, according to USA TODAY .

Fauci, for example, has said that Covid-19 is transferred between people far more easily than the flu and has a mortality rate around 10 times higher. While there was initial confusion over coronavirus when Chinese authorities described it as an unusual form of pneumonia, the world has been well aware of the dimensions of the virus since January, when China acknowledged the severity of the condition and released the genetic information of Covid-19.

Trump was scrutinized for putting Secret Service agents and others in danger of contracting COVID-19. (White House Photo by Tia Dufour) In the instance of Trump and his COVID-19 diagnosis, there are competing narratives coming from his own administration on the reality of his health. Have you seen anything like this in American politics? Putting this into perspective, as far as American political history goes, this whole Trump phenomenon is baffling. The inclination of presidential doctors being protective and duplicitous, or withholding information when it comes to the health of our leaders, is not new. There are many other examples throughout history where the health of presidents was kept secret, from Woodrow Wilson to Franklin Roosevelt and beyond. John F. Kennedy had several diseases and used a lot of medicines which impacted his performance. Dwight Eisenhower had a heart attack and a stroke, and his physicians tried to minimize what the public knew. It\u2019s understandable that leaders want to reassure the public to avoid a panic or a sense of impending crisis. So, what Trump\u2019s doctors did in omitting some things and giving a positive spin to others is pretty much par for the course. But when his Chief of Staff Mark Meadows spilled the beans about the more serious nature of the situation, he created a discrepancy between the narratives we were being fed, exacerbating the distrust in this administration\u2019s ability to tell the truth, which was already extraordinarily high. The sound you could hear in the background was that of chickens coming home to roost. Does Trump have pressure to continue the political narrative he has created around COVID-19, even now, as someone who has the disease? Most of us understand that he is more a showman, a conman, and a grifter, than a statesman or true leader. His exorbitant narcissism, self-interested ploys and endless lies are mercilessly mocked in the media and television. Yet somehow, despite all that, he exercises an extraordinary hold on the still large number of people who support him. How he managed to work this magic will not be easy to explain. But Trump has always tried to embody an ideal of strength and health, and contrast his vitality to the alleged weakness of his opponents. We saw that in his mocking of Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election, when she had pneumonia and was\nterms of the numbers or in terms of the quality.\u201d The president exaggerated the number of tests a bit: 36.3 million had been conducted as of July 3, according to the CDC. The COVID Tracking Project had the total at 34.9 million as of July 4. What those tests show is that 2.8 million people had tested positive for COVID-19 and 122,464 had died in the U.S., as of July 4. That puts the case-fatality rate \u2014 the percentage of confirmed cases that resulted in death \u2014 at more than 4%. Trump is also wrong to say these are \u201cresults that no other country can show.\u201d Several countries have lower case fatality rates than the U.S. Among the 20 countries most affected by COVID-19 now, the U.S. has the sixth highest case fatality rate \u2014 which means 14 other countries have lower rates, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University & Medicine. And, as we\u2019ve written before , the president is wrong to claim other countries don\u2019t have the same \u201cquality\u201d of tests. Rangarajan Sampath , the chief scientific officer of the nonprofit Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics , told us in late April there wasn\u2019t any data to support Trump\u2019s claims that the U.S. tests are better than those in other countries. Morse said: \u201cMost of our tests for the virus are of very good quality, but quality varies, too, and many tests in other countries use the same methodology and are just as good.\u201d Mortality Rates and Disease Severity \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of debate about the infection fatality rate,\u201d Dr. Ashish Jha , faculty director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said in a July 6 press call. \u201cI think the broad consensus in the community is that the infection fatality rate is somewhere between 0.6% and 1%,\u201d but that varies based on whether a population is older or younger. Jha pointed to a study published in the Lancet on July 6 that used antibody tests to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 in Spain. The findings \u2014 that about 5% of the population could have been infected \u2014 suggest an infection fatality rate of 1.2%, as Jha explained in a Twitter thread . Based on several studies in various countries, the World Health Organization\u2019s chief scientist, Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, said on July 2 that the infection fatality rate is about 0.6% \u2014 at least for now, according"}], "source": "rag_only"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 5, "concluded_by_rag": true, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.2}

When Justice Anthony Kennedy retired from the Supreme Court in June 2018, Barrett was allegedly among the finalists to fill the vacancy. The job would go to Justice Brett Kavanaugh, but Trump reportedly told his advisers that he was \u201csaving\u201d Barrett in case Ginsburg were to leave the court during his presidency. Barrett\u2019s nomination and confirmation process played out against the backdrop of President Barack Obama\u2019s March 2016 nomination of Merrick Garland, the highly respected chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to fill the vacancy created by Scalia\u2019s 2016 death. Senate Republicans refused to hold a hearing for Garland, then 63 years old and generally regarded as a more centrist nominee. They maintained that it was too close to the upcoming presidential election, and that the next president, rather than Obama, should choose the new nominee. The seat remained open until April 2017, when Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump\u2019s first Supreme Court nominee, was confirmed. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) paved the way for Barrett\u2019s 2020 nomination last year. When asked at a May 2019 luncheon in Kentucky whether he would fill a vacancy if a Supreme Court justice were to leave the court in 2020, McConnell responded that he would. The difference between such an opening and the situation in 2016, McConnell explained, was that the White House and the Senate in 2016 were controlled by different political parties, while Republicans now hold both the Senate and the White House. But although Ginsburg had announced in December 2018 that she had been treated for lung cancer (the third of what would eventually prove to be five cancer diagnoses), the vacancy was at the time purely a hypothetical one. The hypothetical became real after Ginsburg\u2019s death in September, and McConnell pledged to fill the vacancy quickly. The president was reportedly considering Barrett and two other women \u2013 Judge Barbara Lagoa, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, and Judge Allison Jones Rushing, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit \u2013 to fill the opening left by Ginsburg\u2019s death. But it\u2019s not clear that either woman was ever actually seriously in the running, as the president offered Barrett the job on Sept. 21 and nominated her on Sept. 26,\nwas nominated by Republican president Benjamin Harrison on July 19, 1892.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., labeled the nomination process a \"cynical power grab.\" \"Nearly every Republican in this chamber led by the majority leader four years ago refused to even consider the Supreme Court nomination of a Democratic president on the grounds ... that we should wait until after the presidential election because the American people deserved a voice in the selection of their next justice,\" he said on Sunday. \"My colleagues, there is no escaping this glaring hypocrisy. As I said before, no tit-for-tat convoluted, distorted version of history will wipe away the stain that will exist forever with this Republican majority and with this Republican leader.\" Barrett's nomination cleared a procedural hurdle Sunday afternoon when the Senate voted to end debate on the nomination, days after Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee boycotted a vote to advance Barrett's nomination. The only Republicans who voted against the cloture motion on Sunday were Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. On Saturday, Murkowski previewed her intentions, saying she planned to vote against moving the nomination forward procedurally but would vote to confirm Barrett on Monday. \"While I oppose the process that led us to this point, I do not hold it against her, as an individual who has navigated the gauntlet with grace, skill and humility,\" she said. Collins faces a tough reelection battle and said after Ginsburg's death in September that whoever wins the presidential election should fill the Supreme Court vacancy .

But it\u2019s not clear that either woman was ever actually seriously in the running, as the president offered Barrett the job on Sept. 21 and nominated her on Sept. 26, in a ceremony at the White House that was notable for the dearth of masks and social distancing. At least 11 people who attended the ceremony later tested positive for COVID-19, including the president, two senators, and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. By the time Barrett\u2019s confirmation hearings began on Oct. 12, Democrats had few options to stop the nomination. Instead, they frequently argued that, if confirmed, Barrett would provide a key vote to strike down the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate and, with it, the rest of the law when the Supreme Court hears oral argument on Nov. 10 in a challenge to the mandate. Republican senators emphasized Barrett\u2019s qualifications for the job and her commitment to following the original meaning of the Constitution. Some senators, like Josh Hawley of Missouri, also condemned what they portrayed as attacks on Barrett\u2019s religion. When the Senate Judiciary Committee met on Oct. 22 to consider whether to send Barrett\u2019s nomination to the full Senate, Democratic senators were not there. Knowing they did not have the votes to stop the nomination from moving forward, several of them left photos of their constituents to fill their chairs \u2013 a move intended to symbolize the people who would be hurt if the ACA were struck down. Without any Democratic opposition, Barrett\u2019s nomination was voted out of committee unanimously. Going into Monday\u2019s final vote, there was little suspense about how the vote might turn out. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) had opposed moving forward with the confirmation process this close to the election, but she announced on Saturday that she would support Barrett\u2019s confirmation. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who had voted two years ago to confirm Kavanaugh, announced that she would vote against Barrett. No Democrats crossed party lines to vote for Barrett. In a ceremony at the White House shortly after the vote, Justice Clarence Thomas administered the constitutional oath, one of the two oaths that Barrett must take. The Supreme Court\u2019s Public Information Office announced on Monday night that Chief Justice John Roberts would administer the second oath, the judicial oath, on Tuesday in\nBarrett confirmed as 115th justice - SCOTUSblog Skip to content Barrett confirmed as 115th justice By Amy Howe on Oct 27, 2020 The Senate on Monday night confirmed Judge Amy Coney Barrett as the 115th justice of the U.S. Supreme Court and the fifth woman to serve on the court. The 48-year-old Barrett fills the seat previously held by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died on Sept. 18 of complications from pancreatic cancer. The 52-48 vote capped a meteoric rise for Barrett, who spent almost all of her career as a law professor who was well regarded but little known outside academic circles. And for conservatives, the vote represented the culmination of a decades-long effort to move the ideological balance on the court solidly to the right. In contrast to Ginsburg, who spent nearly three decades as one of the court\u2019s most reliably liberal votes, Barrett has said that her judicial philosophy is similar to that of the late conservative hero Justice Antonin Scalia, for whom Barrett served as a law clerk. Democrats decried the decision to confirm Barrett less than two weeks before the upcoming presidential election, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) warned that the \u201cAmerican people will suffer the consequences of Judge Barrett\u2019s far-right, out-of-the-mainstream views for generations.\u201d Barrett catapulted onto the national scene in 2017, during the confirmation hearings for her seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit. Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee suggested that Barrett, who is a devout Catholic, might allow her faith to influence her judging \u2013 an allegation that Barrett staunchly denied. And perhaps most notably, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California told Barrett that, based on Barrett\u2019s speeches, \u201cthe conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within you.\u201d Feinstein\u2019s rhetoric did not keep Barrett from being confirmed to the court of appeals, by a vote of 55 to 43, on Oct. 31, 2017. In fact, it may have had the opposite effect: Conservative Catholics adopted the phrase as a rallying cry, putting it on coffee mugs and t-shirts, and Barrett\u2019s name was one of five names added in November 2017 to President Donald Trump\u2019s list of potential nominees to the Supreme Court. When Justice Anthony Kennedy retired from the Supreme Court in June 2018, Barrett was allegedly among the finalists to fill the vacancy. The job would go to Justice Brett Kavanaugh, but Trump\nthe advancement of Barrett's nomination so close to Election Day, after the Republican-led Senate in 2016 refused to hold hearings for then-President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, nearly eight months before that year's election. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., labeled the nomination process a \"cynical power grab.\" \"Nearly every Republican in this chamber led by the majority leader four years ago refused to even consider the Supreme Court nomination of a Democratic president on the grounds ... that we should wait until after the presidential election because the American people deserved a voice in the selection of their next justice,\" he said on Sunday. \"My colleagues, there is no escaping this glaring hypocrisy. As I said before, no tit-for-tat convoluted, distorted version of history will wipe away the stain that will exist forever with this Republican majority and with this Republican leader.\" Barrett's nomination cleared a procedural hurdle Sunday afternoon when the Senate voted to end debate on the nomination, days after Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee boycotted a vote to advance Barrett's nomination. The only Republicans who voted against the cloture motion on Sunday were Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. On Saturday, Murkowski previewed her intentions, saying she planned to vote against moving the nomination forward procedurally but would vote to confirm Barrett on Monday. \"While I oppose the process that led us to this point, I do not hold it against her, as an individual who has navigated the gauntlet with grace, skill and humility,\" she said. Collins faces a tough reelection battle and said after Ginsburg's death in September that whoever wins the presidential election should fill the Supreme Court vacancy . The 48-year-old judge's confirmation solidifies the court's conservative majority, potentially shaping the future of abortion rights and health care law for generations. Elections Pence Aides Test Positive As Coronavirus Consumes Final Days Of Campaign During a campaign event in Tallahassee, Fla., on Saturday, Vice President Pence said he wanted to return to Capitol Hill in time for Monday's vote. \"As vice president, I'm president of the Senate,\" Pence said. \"And I'm gonna be in the chair because I wouldn't miss that vote for the world.\" He ultimately did not attend the vote in person.

She was held captive for several months and tragically died in February 2015.\n\n2. **U.S. Government Response**: The U.S. government, including the Obama administration (of which Joe Biden was Vice President), was involved in efforts to rescue Mueller. However, the timeline and effectiveness of these efforts have been subjects of scrutiny and debate.\n\n3. **Claims of Delay**: The statement claims that there was a month-long delay in acting on information that could have potentially saved Mueller. This assertion would require specific evidence of the timeline of actions taken by the U.S. government and the nature of the information received.\n\n4. **Public Statements and Investigations**: There have been various reports and investigations into the U.S. government's response to Mueller's kidnapping. Some reports suggest that there were opportunities for rescue that were not acted upon swiftly, while others indicate that the complexities of dealing with ISIS made immediate action difficult.\n\n5. **Biden's Role**: As Vice President, Biden was part of the administration's decision-making process, but the specific actions taken or not taken would need to be evaluated against the broader context of U.S. counter-terrorism efforts and the challenges faced in negotiating with terrorist groups.\n\nIn summary, while there are claims of delays in the U.S. government's response to Kayla Mueller's situation, the statement's assertion that they \"took a month to act\" requires careful examination of the timeline and the nature of the information available at that time.

The man accused of the killing, Michael Reinoehl, was shot by US marshals five days later. Overall, however, data show that Antifa activists have been involved in relatively few violent incidents compared to white supremacists, who have conducted at least 40 lethal attacks since 2018 according to the Department of Homeland Security. Despite this, Trump and his attorney general, William Barr, have accused the Antifa movement of being the main instigators of violence, looting and public unrest. This is what serves as justification for the administration\u2019s labeling them as \u201ca domestic terrorist group\u201d. For both legal and political reasons, such accusations are immediately met with scepticism and criticism. Because the United States has no domestic terror law \u2013 something opposed by both progressive and conservative public officials \u2013 the only possibility would be to place the Antifa movement on the list of \u201cforeign terrorist organizations\u201d, something that has no basis in fact. The alternative would be take thousands of activists to court, thus criminalizing political beliefs and violating fundamental rights guaranteed by the US Constitution. A polarized country So does the Antifa movement represent a real threat to American democracy? Let us look more broadly at the partisan, political conflict that is being felt across the country. The Antifa movement is part of a polarization of political views that is eroding one the foundations of the American republic, the mutual recognition of the legitimacy of both political sides. The groups against which the Antifa movement positions itself, including white supremacists, neo-fascists and right-wing nationalists , have been involved in numerous violent actions and killings . However, the Antifa movement\u2019s own actions can contribute to the legitimization of violence, escalate conflicts rather than defuse them, and expose peaceful protesters to danger. Calls for violence , whatever the source, can also be used\n1 Person Dead In Shooting That Followed Day Of Far-Right, Far-Left Rallies In Denver : NPR Accessibility links Skip to main content Keyboard shortcuts for audio player 1 Person Dead In Shooting That Followed Day Of Far-Right, Far-Left Rallies In Denver Police said a private security guard was taken into custody as a suspect in connection with the shooting.

The shooting came at the end of a day of competing rallies by far-right and far-left demonstrators. Helen H. Richardson/MediaNews Group/The Denver Post via Getty Images One person was killed and another man is in police custody after a fatal shooting in Denver on Saturday that occurred toward the end of dueling rallies by activists on the far right and the far left. The Denver Police Department said it had taken a private security guard into custody in connection with the shooting. On Sunday, the department identified the suspect as 30-year-old Matthew Dolloff. He has not been formally charged. A local news channel, 9News, said it had contracted Dolloff through the Pinkerton security firm as a guard to accompany staff covering the protest. Contracting private security to protect reporters and producers at protests has been a practice at the outlet for several months, 9News said. The shooting took place near the Denver Art Museum when competing far-left and far-right protests were winding down nearby. Activists from the far left were in the area for a Black Lives Matter Anti-Fascist Soup Drive organized by the Denver Communists, the Colorado Socialist Revolution and other groups, according to Colorado Public Radio . The right-wing demonstrators had gathered for what was billed as a Patriot Muster organized by John \"Tig\"\n7, 2021 That man was later identified as Jake Angeli, a noted supporter of a conspiracy cult called Qanon and a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump. Angeli is a well-known protester covered previously by Arizona Central . Supporters had planned the events online , using social media apps like Parler to express support for the rallies scheduled on Thursday. Other false claims also indicated that Antifa protestors were \u201cescorted\u201d into the Capitol by police to cause the disruption. Metropolitan police denied the claim, telling Reuters they do not act as a private security escort. If the identification of well-known right-wing activists is not convincing enough to dispel the notion that Antifa was involved in the Capitol, consider Trump\u2019s own messages to the rioters he was telling to go home. \u201cWe love you, you\u2019re very special,\u201d he told them in a video that was later taken down by Twitter and Facebook. \u201cBut go home, and go home in peace.\u201d Copyright 2021 by KSAT - All rights reserved.

Johnson has since said that he doesn't want the violent actions of a few to be used to impugn all. Rep. Andrew Clyde, after watching video footage of rioters walking through the Capitol, said it resembled a \"normal tourist visit.\" Other video evidence from Jan. 6 showed Clyde, R-Ga., helping barricade the House doors in an attempt to keep the rioters out. Trump called the insurrection a display of \" spirit and faith and love .\" Rioters also broke windows and doors, stole items from offices and caused an estimated $1.5 million in damage. Outside the Capitol someone set up a gallows with a noose . \"The notion that this was somehow a tourist event is disgraceful and despicable,\" Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said in May. \"And, you know, I won't be part of whitewashing what happened on Jan. 6. Nobody should be part of it. And people ought to be held accountable.\" ___ CLAIM: TRUMP DID NOT ENCOURAGE THE RIOTERS Trump may now want to minimize his involvement, but he spent months sounding a steady drumbeat of conspiracy theory and grievance, urging his followers to fight to somehow return him to power. \"Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,\" Trump tweeted on Dec. 19, 2020. \"Be there, will be wild!\" Immediately before the mob stormed the Capitol, Trump spoke for more than an hour, telling his supporters they had been \"cheated\" and \"defrauded\" in the \"rigged\" election by a \"criminal enterprise\" that included lawmakers who were now meeting in the Capitol. At one point, Trump did urge his supporters to \"peacefully and patriotically make your voice heard.\" The rest of his speech was filled with hostile rhetoric. \"We fight. We fight like hell,\" he told those who would later break into the Capitol. \"And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\" Now, Trump says he had nothing to do with the riot. \"I wasn't involved in that, and if you look at my words and what I said in the speech, they were extremely calming actually,\" Trump said on Fox News in December. Nearly two-thirds of Americans believe Trump bears some responsibility for the Capitol breach, according to a survey last year by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. ___ CLAIM: ASHLI BABBITT WAS KILLED BY AN"}], "source": "rag_only"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 5, "concluded_by_rag": true, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.2}

On Twitter alt-right activists, conservative journalists, and others who had urged Clinton's prosecution over the emails - took up the \"pizzagate\" cause with renewed vigour. Image source, @cernovich/Twitter Image source, @BrittPettibone/Twitter Despite the complete lack of physical evidence or victim testimony, there are reasons why the hardcore conspiracy theorists are particularly sensitive to allegations of child sex abuse. It's known, for instance that Bill Clinton and Donald Trump flew on the private plane of convicted child abuser Jeffery Epstein , external . Tony Podesta, the brother of the Clinton aide whose emails were hacked, was a friend of Dennis Hastert, a Republican politician who earlier this year was sentenced to 15 months in prison , and has admitted abusing boys. The Jimmy Savile scandal in the UK has featured in speculation as an example of a serial child abuser getting away with his crimes. Viren Swami, professor of social psychology at Anglia Ruskin University, says \"pizzagate\" might well be an example of a trend in a hyper-partisan America, where conspiracy theories become fodder for political factions. \"What's happening in the US over the last year or two is that conspiracy theorising is being deployed as a political weapon,\" he says. \"And that's a very big change in the way that conspiracy narratives are being used.\" The saga has prompted debunkers by the New York Times , external and Fox News , external , among many others, but no factual news story has slowed the torrent of Tweets from the true believers. \"There is some evidence that presenting critical information can reduce belief in a theory, but only among people who have not made up their minds yet,\" Swami says. \"For the people who have already made up their minds, it probably won't change anything.\" Other stories have fuelled the rumours and prompted claims of a cover up.

Gender Affirming Care . The Trump administration has issued an order titled \u201cDefending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,\u201d which essentially removes the concept of gender identity from federal government policies and procedures, including removing health care afforded to people on that basis. President Trump also rescinded a number of orders from the Biden-era that promoted protections on the basis of sex and gender identity in schools, and did away with the Gender Policy Council. These new orders are consistent with the President\u2019s promises on the campaign trail and in his inauguration speech, but legal challenges are likely. 6. Immigration . Another Biden-era policy rescinded by President Trump includes a policy not to arrest people without legal residency at or near \u201csensitive locations,\u201d which includes hospitals, which Congress had attempted to formalize in 2023. The purpose of the rescission is to boost the ability of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to enforce immigration laws. The effect on health care is that immigrants could potentially be arrested in hospitals and while receiving medical care. Health care providers and facilities should pay close attention to immigration policy updates under the Trump administration. 7. Covid-19 . President Trump acted to revoke several policies implemented by former President Biden, the purpose of which were aimed at responding to the Covid-19 pandemic and future infectious disease outbreaks by bolstering testing, research into treatments, providing economic relief, and enhancing cooperation with other countries in the event of another pandemic. For the most part, these rescissions remove lingering policies that have run their course after the Covid-19 pandemic. 8. Abortion Spending . President Trump has signed an Executive Order to end the use of Federal taxpayer dollars to fund or promote \u201celective abortion\u201d by reinstating the Hyde Amendment, which was passed in 1976 and attached Medicaid appropriations to the restriction of federal funding from supporting abortions. On the same day, President Trump also signed an Order reinstating the Mexico City Policy, which had been rescinded by former President Biden. The Mexico City Policy requires foreign nongovernmental agencies to certify that they don\u2019t provide or promote abortion if they receive U.S. federal funds for family planning assistance.

Chuck Schumer have an affair with a 16-year-old girl ? A: No. That claim was originally made up by a self-described satirical website, but has been circulating on right-wing social media accounts as though it happened. FULL ANSWER What started out as a joke has turned into ammunition for right-wing social media accounts to defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of committing sexual assault in the 1980s. The transformation from parody to recrimination took place over the course of almost a year. Here\u2019s how it happened: In December 2017, America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, a site that describes its content as satire aimed at provoking conservatives, posted a made-up story claiming that Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer had impregnated a 16-year-old girl. The hoax story was related to allegations at the time that Roy Moore , the Republican who lost a special Senate election in Alabama, had pursued sexual relationships with underage girls when he was in his 30s. The bogus Schumer story was then copied by other websites that presented it as if it were real and without a satire disclaimer. A conspiracy-theorist blogger and YouTube personality then took the story and embellished it in a post headlined: \u201c BREAKING: Chuck Schumer, Democrat Senate Minority Leader, Accused of Raping His Daughter\u2019s 16 Year Old Friend: Friend Then \u2018Committed Suicide\u2019 \u201d That post became the basis of a recent attack on Schumer by Lori Hendry , a popular Twitter personality who describes herself as an \u201cunapologetic conservative.\u201d Hendry, who has about 246,000 followers, shared the false story about Schumer in a tweet defending Kavanaugh. Dear Chuck Schumer you were accused of raping your daughter\u2019s 16-year-old friend who then committed suicide. u categorically denied guilt. Judge Kavanaugh is accused of a much lesser accusation and emphatically denying it too so why do you gounscathed and he is being crucified? \u2014 Lori Hendry (@Lrihendry) September 18, 2018 Hendry\u2019s tweet was retweeted 15,000 times and liked 23,000 times. It then migrated to Facebook, where it was shared thousands of times as a meme. But there are red flags that the story is not true. For example, it claims that Schumer\u2019s daughter, \u201cLisa Schumer,\u201d exposed her father\u2019s past relationship with her childhood\nto stop the spread of conspiracy theories. Trump Retweets Dated, Racially Charged Post President Trump retweeted a video, which had been posted under the misleading heading \u201cBlack Lives Matter/Antifa,\u201d of a Black man shoving a white woman into a stopped subway car. The incident occurred on Oct. 23, 2019, and there is no indication that the man in the video was affiliated with either Black Lives Matter or antifa.

Different versions of the claim suggest they were FBI operatives or members of the anti-fascist movement antifa . \"Earlier today, the Capitol was under siege by people who can only be described as antithetical to the MAGA movement,\" Laura Ingraham said on her Fox News show the night of Jan. 6, referring to Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" slogan. \"They were likely not all Trump supporters, and there are some reports that antifa sympathizers may have been sprinkled throughout the crowd.\" The next day, Ingraham acknowledged the inaccuracy when she tweeted a link to a story debunking the claim. Another Fox host, Tucker Carlson, has spread the idea that the FBI orchestrated the riot. He cites as evidence the indictments of some Jan. 6 suspects that mention unindicted co-conspirators, a common legal term that merely refers to suspects who haven't been charged, and not evidence of undercover agents or informants. Yet Carlson claimed on his show that \"in potentially every single case, they were FBI operatives.\" Carlson is a \"main driver\" of the idea that Jan. 6 was perpetrated by agents of the government, according to Zignal's report. It found the claim spiked in October when Carlson released a documentary series about the insurrection. Members of Congress, including Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., have helped spread the theories. \"Some of the people who breached the Capitol today were not Trump supporters, they were masquerading as Trump supporters and, in fact, were members of the violent terrorist group antifa,\" Gaetz said.

Full Episode Monday, Feb 2\nFact check US: Is there an \u2018antifa threat\u2019 in the United States, as Donald Trump claims? Antifa activists on the streets of Salem, Oregon, at a rally of extreme right-wing groups such as the Patriot Prayer and the Proud Boys on September 7. Allison Dinner/AFP Ever since the antiracism protests that followed the May 25 death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers, President Donald Trump has repeatedly asserted that that Antifa (short for \u201cantifascist\u201d) groups threaten American democracy. On September 30, he once again called them (in his usual style) \u201ca very bad group\u201d , which he says should be considered a \u201cterrorist organization\u201d. The origins of the antifascist movement The term refers more to an amorphous movement than an association, a flexible network of activists who share a general philosophy, sometimes try to coordinate their activities, but generally operate spontaneously, responding to events at a highly local level. There\u2019s no hierarchy, official status or precise system of organization. Local groups are independent and do not announce their actions ahead of time. The number of members varies, increasing or decreasing depending on the circumstances. Sometimes they can work with loosely structured organizations such as Black Lives Matter, other times they work by themselves. Their sometimes violent actions have been rejected by many protest organizers working for causes that Antifa groups care about \u2013 authoritarianism and antifascism, racism, homophobia and xenophobia, for example. All this means that it is difficult to establish the exact genealogy of the Antifa movement. The oldest group in operation, Rose City Antifa , was created in Portland, Oregon, in 2007, with the aim of shutting down a neo-Nazi music festival. While Trump singled out the Antifa movement after his election, they gained prominence after the tragic events in Charlottesville, Virginia, on August 11, 2017. That day a rally by white supremacists and neo-Nazis also attracted counter-protestors, including Antifa activists. They were demonstrating peacefully when James Alex Fields Jr., a white supremacist, drove his car into the crowd, killing one person and injuring more than a dozen others. Fields\u2019s actions were deemed a terrorist attack and he currently in prison serving two life sentences without the possibility of parole. In response to the deadly violence perpetrated by Fields, Trump claimed that there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d and in the first presidential debate refused to condemn violent right-wing groups. His remarks\nto stop the spread of conspiracy theories. Trump Retweets Dated, Racially Charged Post President Trump retweeted a video, which had been posted under the misleading heading \u201cBlack Lives Matter/Antifa,\u201d of a Black man shoving a white woman into a stopped subway car.

{"claim": "Govt of India is providing money to bereaved families of COVID-19 - Insurance benefits for Covid-19 deaths can be claimed under the schemes of PMJJBY and PMSBY.", "label": "Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking", "result": {"response": "To assess the factual accuracy of the statement regarding the Indian government's provision of financial support to bereaved families of COVID-19, we need to analyze the relevant knowledge points.\n\n1. **Government Support for COVID-19 Deaths**: The statement claims that the Government of India is providing money to bereaved families of COVID-19. This aligns with various reports and announcements made by the government during the pandemic, where financial assistance was indeed provided to families who lost members due to COVID-19.\n\n2. **Insurance Benefits under PMJJBY and PMSBY**: The statement mentions that insurance benefits for COVID-19 deaths can be claimed under the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY). Both of these schemes are government-backed insurance programs that provide financial support in the event of death or disability. \n\n3. **Relevance of the Schemes**: PMJJBY provides life insurance coverage, while PMSBY offers accidental death and disability coverage.

The government has indeed provided financial assistance to families affected by COVID-19, and the mentioned insurance schemes are relevant for claiming benefits in such cases.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"True\"\n}\n```", "answer": "True"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "early signs most people miss 6 detox water recipes that can support weight loss and clear skin What every woman needs to unlearn about her health: The truth you must know 1 2 3 Hot Picks Big Beautiful Bill Chicago Shooting HDB Financial Services Post Office Saving Schemes Anti Trump Protests Skydiving plane crashes Gold Price Prediction Top Trending Cardi B Tom Brady Taylor Swift Trail Blazer Napheesa Collier Caitlyn Jenner Puka Nacuas Bryan Braman India vs England Test live Tamil Nadu Custodial Death Tired of too many ads? go ad free now Trending Stories In India Entire Website 'Ghana ghoom rahe hain': Sanjay Raut takes 'vikas purush' jibe at PM Modi, flags poor roads in Varanasi Uttarakhand CM Dhami lauds 4 years of governance, highlights implementation of UCC Maharashtra government removes 2289 ineligible women from Mukhyamantri Ladki Bahin scheme Landmark Land Law Reforms: CM Dhami marks 4 years of Uttarakhand government's progressive agenda From access to agency: Uplifting India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s marginalised 'Bihar ki beti': PM Modi hails ancestral ties of Trinidad and Tobago PM Kamla Persad; welcomed with Bhojpuri Chautaal Startups to giants: India rides the AI wave to sustainability Oppn backing move to oust Justice Varma, process to initiate motion to start soon: Rijiju Centre's pick & choose policy hits HC judge appointments Spy planes, minesweepers: Nod for 1 lakh crore purchases Caitlyn Jenner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s manager, Sophia Hutchins dies in tragic ATV accident at 29 CUET Result 2025 Live Updates: NTA to release scores at cuet.nta.nic.in to guide admissions at 243 universities, including DU, JNU and others IND vs ENG: Records galore as Shubman Gill joins Don Bradman, Gary Sobers in historic feat July school holidays 2025: Is 7 July a holiday for students?

The Prime Minister applied for a loan of Rs 5,000 loan which was sanctioned the same day. But soon tragedy struck the family and the nation.

This indicates a nuanced position where she separates the act of endorsement from her overall support.\n\n2. **Key Points from Knowledge**: \n   - The statement reflects a common political stance where a politician may choose not to formally endorse a candidate while still expressing support for their policies or actions.\n   - It is important to verify if there is a record of Sen. Collins making such a statement, as well as the context in which it was made.\n\n3. **Fact-Checking**: \n   - We need to check if there are any credible sources or news articles that document Sen. Collins making this specific statement about Trump.\n   - If such a statement exists in the public domain, it would support the claim's accuracy.\n\nAfter conducting a review of available information, it is confirmed that Sen.

Conclusion: The studies reviewed indicate that while mask-wearing had some impact on language comprehension, emotion recognition, and social interactions, children displayed adaptability and resilience in many areas of development. The mixed findings on the psychosocial impacts underscore the importance of context-specific studies and targeted interventions to support children's development in the post-pandemic era. Further longitudinal research is needed to understand the long-term effects of mask-wearing on children's developmental trajectories. From the studies conducted after the Pandemic, it can be concluded that the wearing of masks by young children did not have a deleterious effect on language development, speech, and hearing.

This new virus was first identified in the city of Wuhan in the Hubei province 1 . Since then, it has spread to over 203 countries, and was officially declared as a global pandemic illness by the World Health Organization (WHO) 2 . After almost 2 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has left a toll of 446 million infected and more than 6.0 million deaths worldwide 3 . From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of facemasks (FMs) has been controversial due to political, cultural and economic causes. However, multiple studies have highlighted the efficiency of FM in the reduction of COVID-19 transmission (i.e., from 6 to 80%) 4 . In another report the use of medical/surgical masks reduced the transmission rates by 85% 5 . Countries worldwide have adapted many different approaches to control the disease 6 . Non-pharmaceutical actions included the use gowns, gloves, and FM, all of which have been proven to be effective and more recently, the use of vaccines such as the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine, Curevac, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Sino pharm has proven effective in the control of the pandemic 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 . Some side effects associated with the use of FMs have been reported. The most common side effect described by healthcare workers was bilateral headaches (affecting up to 80% of users), dermatitis, itchy rash and elevated heart rates 11 . However, the WHO has advised populations to wear FMs on a large scale only excluding patients with limited respiratory conditions 4 . Recently updated guidelines issued by the WHO advised the use of FMs as part of its prevention recommendations which also included hand hygiene, physical distance of at least 1 m, avoidance of face touching and adequate indoor ventilation 2 , 12 . Previous clinical studies have addressed the potential impact of FMs on brain and cognitive functions 13 , 14 . One study in healthy young people showed that the 150-min use of surgical mask had no significant mental fatigue perception 13 while another showed that the prolonged use of FMs can result in headache and impaired\nThe participants were investigated during 2 different sessions 72 h apart with all tests performed in the morning. The study was carried out by the Neuroscience and Respiratory team at Jordan University Hospital (JUH) and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by our institutional review board committee (IRB) (reference number 10-2021-4251) at JUH. A written informed consent form was obtained from all participants and informed consent for publication of the image was obtained from the participant. Measures (day 1) All demographic and general data were gathered at the beginning of the study, in day one. Respiratory function (spirometry) We used VIASYS Health Care device (model Vmax Ecnone; S/N77400SEP05, GmbH, made in Germany) to determine the forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (EFV1) and FEV1/FVC] ratio. The preparation of participants included the removal of tight clothes, and placement of a soft clip was on the nose with a sterile mouthpiece and filter attached to the spirometer. For the respiratory procedures, participants took deep breaths, followed by a breath hold for a second, forced exhalation into the mouthpiece for 6 s, followed by another deep breath. The test was repeated three times to make sure that the results were consistent. The highest the reading was considered as the tests result. In spirometry, the FEV1/FVC was calculated from the FEV1 and FVC results. The device used the predicted values to provide FVC, EFV1 percentages and FEV1/FVC ratio for the test subjects. EEG measurement, acquisitions and analysis Baseline phase, (without FMs): We used Nihon Kohden Electroencephalograph, model EEG 1200, female connector plugs 1.5 cm (Nihon Kohden Corporation, 1-31-4-Nishiochiai, Shinjuku, Toky0, 161-8560, Japan). There were 22 electrodes type H-526 Nihon Kohden (reusable Collodion EEG Cup Electrode of silver Ag arranged via an augmented 10\u201320) (NIHON KOHDEN India Pvt Ltd, India,) 20 for EEG, output of 16, and channels; two chest electrodes for electrocardiography (ECG) output channel, and respiratory frequency/minute) (Fig. 1 b). We used anterior posterior montage \"double banana\", sensitivity 10\u00b5v for EEG, 50\u00b5v for ECG, time constant; 0.1 s, high cut frequency filter: 70 Hz. EEG measurements were done in the morning with the volunteers fasting after midnight. The technician scrubbed the spots that were measured with a special skin preparation gel for active electrodes (NuPrep), (Ten20 conductive electrode paste, Weaver and Company 565, Nuprep skin, Nucla way.

For years before that, Trump repeatedly has called for his investigation and prosecution. \"He's \"a real sort of a low life\" Trump said of Bolton after the FBI searched his house in August. A lawyer for Bolton previously told USA TODAY many of the referenced materials were \" previously approved \" in a review before Bolton published his 2020 book, \"The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,\" which infuriated Trump because of its criticisms of him. James Comey \u2014 former FBI director Comey was indicted Sept. 25 for allegedly lying to Congress and obstruction, just days after Trump told Bondi that time was running out on the statute of limitations to prosecute him. The charges came after months of Trump pressure, and after Trump replaced a U.S. attorney who reportedly declined to pursue the case with a political loyalist in the Eastern District of Virginia in Alexandria, Va. Comey has pleaded not guilty and intends to try and get the case thrown out on the grounds of vindictive and selective prosecution and other issues. Letitia James \u2014 New York attorney general James was indicted Oct. 9 on charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution, just weeks after Trump publicly called for her to face charges . James' office sued Trump civilly in 2022 , alleging he fraudulently inflated the value of his assets for years to get better loan deals. Trump has began accusing her of wrongdoing ever since. Next on Trump's hit list: Jack Smith, former Justice Department special counsel Smith has been a longtime target of Trump\u2019s since leading the two criminal investigations into him, for his alleged mishandling of classified government records and for his role in allegedly fomenting the violence during the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack. \u201cDeranged Jack Smith, in my opinion, is a criminal,\u201d Trump told reporters at his Oct. 15 White House event, as Bondi, Blanche and Patel stood beside him. Andrew\nwhen Schiff was a House lawmaker. \u201cI\u2019m looking at Pam because I hope something\u2019s going to be done about it,\u201d Trump in August, in reference to his attorney general. \u201cIt was a hoax created by the Democrats, but in particular, Schiff, crooked Hillary, the whole group.\u201d Trump has also repeatedly accused Schiff, who denies wrongdoing, of making up lies about him and Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The Justice Department is investigating Schiff for potential mortgage fraud, which Schiff has also denied. That prompted Schiff to set up a legal defense fund in August. Christopher Wray, former Trump FBI director Trump famously soured on his own appointed FBI director before prompting Wray to resign from his 10-year appointed post following Trump\u2019s election last November. Trump has since hinted Wray could be subject to scrutiny or even charges, including for Trump\u2019s unfounded claim that the FBI incited the Jan. 6, 2021 assault on the U.S. Capitol carried out by his own supporters to prevent certification of Biden's victory. \u201cMany Great American Patriots were made to pay a very big price only for the love of their Country,\u201d Trump wrote in a Sept. 27 Truth Social post. \u201cChristopher Wray, the then Director of the FBI, has some major explaining to do.\u201d Trump told NBC News Sept. 28 last month that he \u201cwould certainly imagine \u201d that the DOJ was investigating Wray due to his \u201cinappropriate\u201d behavior as director. George Soros, billionaire philanthropist and donor to liberal causes The Justice Department reportedly is investigating billionaire philanthropist George Soros and his son, Alex, following repeated attacks on the duo by Trump and his supporters. A top Justice Department official reportedly directed several federal prosecutor offices to investigate the liberal donor and his Open Society Foundations network, just weeks after Trump posted on social media that Soros and his son should be criminally charged . Aakash Singh, a senior Justice Department official, issued the order in a letter to at least a handful of U.S. attorney's offices, including offices in New York and California, according to Sept. 25 reports from the New York Times and ABC News . The New York Times said it obtained a copy of the letter, while ABC News cited multiple anonymous sources who confirmed contents of the letter.

KENOSHA, WISCONSIN - NOVEMBER 10: Kyle Rittenhouse makes his way back to the stand to testify during his trial at the Kenosha County Courthouse on November 10, 2021 in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Rittenhouse is accused of shooting three demonstrators, killing two of them, during a night of unrest that erupted in Kenosha after a police officer shot Jacob Blake seven times in the back while being arrested in August 2020. Rittenhouse, from Antioch, Illinois, was 17 at the time of the shooting and armed with an assault rifle. He faces counts of felony homicide and felony attempted homicide.

We don\u2019t execute you on the street.\u201d Rittenhouse testified he acted in self-defense when he shot four times at Rosenbaum, who he said had threatened him earlier, chased him, thrown a bag at him and lunged for his gun. Jason Lackowski, a former Marine who testified for the state, said Rosenbaum acted \u201cbelligerently\u201d and asked to be shot but was not perceived as a serious threat. Rittenhouse referred to the three other people he shot at as part of a \u201cmob\u201d chasing him. Kyle Rittenhouse takes the stand in court on Wednesday, November 10, 2021.

Rittenhouse \u201cwas the aggressor, there with the intent to violently clash with those opposed to his beliefs,\u201d prosecutors have said. Prosecutors had hoped to bolster their case by introducing as evidence a brief video taken 15 days before the protest shootings that shows Rittenhouse watching some men exit a CVS pharmacy and commenting that he wished he had his rifle so he could shoot them because prosecutors say he baselessly thought they were shoplifters. Thomas Binger, the lead prosecutor, said it showed Rittenhouse's mindset as \u201ca teenage vigilante, involving himself in things that don't concern him.\u201d But Judge Bruce Schroeder questioned the relevance of the video to the charges. He ruled it wouldn't be allowed, though he suggested he could reassess that ruling later. Schroeder has also blocked prosecutors from connecting Rittenhouse to the far-right extremist group the Proud Boys. Rittenhouse was photographed in January in a Wisconsin bar with some Proud Boys members, but his attorneys say Rittenhouse had no affiliation or involvement with the group. In this image from video provided by the Kenosha County District Attorney, Kyle Rittenhouse poses for a photo at Pudgy's Pub in Mount Pleasant, Wis., on Jan. 5, 2021, the day he was arraigned on charges related to the killing of two people at an August protest in Kenosha.

First, they have to decide if Rittenhouse really believed he was in peril. Hindsight may show he was wrong. But did he sincerely believe it at the time? Next, they must determine if Rittenhouse\u2019s belief was objectively \u201creasonable.\u201d To make that call, jurors will be instructed to consider whether any reasonable person in Rittenhouse\u2019s shoes would have also felt they had no choice but to shoot.

Far-right groups celebrated the verdict in the Rittenhouse trial. John Locher/AP In the minutes after a jury acquitted 18-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse on all counts, jubilation lit up on social media spaces where far-right extremists gather. In one Telegram channel for the far-right Proud Boys, some noted they had taken the day off work to await the verdict. \"There's still a chance for this country,\" wrote one. In another channel, a member stated that political violence must continue. \"The left wont stop until their bodied get stacked up like cord wood,\" he wrote. Rittenhouse himself is not known to be a member of an extremist group. But the trial, which from its beginning became a cause and rallying cry among conservatives who champion gun rights, has been particularly alarming to extremism researchers. As it played out against the backdrop of an increasingly polarized nation, experts of far-right movements say opportunists found a growing audience for their violence-fueled messaging that targets the left. Now that a jury has found that Rittenhouse acted in self-defense, those concerns are recentering on the question of whether it may embolden others to engage in political violence.

One hypothesis is that the lingering symptoms are the result of the immune system still reacting to the virus, even if infectious virus is long gone from the body. Experts also have concerns that some proportion of those who survive severe COVID-19 infections may be left with organ damage. \u201cThe amount of lung damage that we\u2019re seeing in a lot of CAT scans make me very worried about functional capacity and long-term lung function in a lot of these people who survive,\u201d Jha said. \u201cAnd so my best guess \u2014 and it is just a guess \u2014 is a sizable minority of people who end up getting infected, I don\u2019t know, 10, 20% of people will end up having meaningful long-term clinical effects of this virus.\u201d The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute launched an observational study in June to investigate the long-term health effects of having been hospitalized with COVID-19, with a special focus on the heart and lungs.

Trump\u2019s doctors have acknowledged withholding information about his health after contracting COVID-19, something other administrations have done in the past. (White House photo by Tia Dufour) President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has long been a \u201cbaffling phenomenon\u201d for political historians like UC Berkeley\u2019s Martin Jay, a professor emeritus of history, who has studied political untruth for more than 50 years. The information swirling as Trump and his allies communicate strength, health and resolve in the face of the president\u2019s COVID-19 diagnosis and weekend-long hospital stay makes clear just how polarized the truth has become, he said. Martin Jay is UC Berkeley\u2019s Sidney Hellman Ehrman Professor of History Emeritus. (UC Berkeley photo) \u201cIt\u2019s no longer about whether someone is telling the truth or lying, but rather, who that person is and what our characterological assumptions are of them that makes them a truthteller or a hypocrite,\u201d said Jay. \u201cThat\u2019s a real problem \u2014 when you can\u2019t fully trust anybody anymore.\u201d Jay is the author of The Virtues of Mendacity: On Lying in Politics , a book that explores the historical role that lies and hypocrisy have played in American politics and presidencies. He spoke with Berkeley News recently about how the Trump administration\u2019s use of lies and misinformation has sowed doubt in what the public believes. Berkeley News : There are people who don\u2019t believe Trump has COVID-19. Where does that doubt come from? Martin Jay: We have developed a very complicated attitude toward people who have traditionally given us information, with many people no longer confident that they are telling the truth. This applies to both camps in our current polarized political culture. This president and his people have bent the truth so often that people don\u2019t believe what they say. They take all of it with an immense grain of salt. Trump squandered away the ability to come off as sincere, because for most of us, he lacks the fundamental capacity for sincerity. In American politics, it\u2019s always been the\n\u201ctotally harmless.\u201d In addition to those who die, many are hospitalized. In June, the CDC published data on the 1.3 million reported cases in the U.S. from Jan. 22 to May 30, finding: \u201cOverall, 184,673 (14%) patients were hospitalized, 29,837 (2%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and 71,116 (5%) died.\u201d A study published in late February by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention similarly found that 14% of cases in mainland China were severe and 5% were critical. The latter category included \u201crespiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure.\u201d The WHO also says that 13.8% of confirmed coronavirus patients have severe disease and 6.1% have critical cases. Beyond the harm caused by being sick and hospitalized, there are the financial ramifications of that treatment, the impact on hospitals of the pandemic and the burden to the U.S. health system, Riley said. And even those who have mild symptoms may transmit the infection to others. \u201cThey can still pass it on to others, who may get sick or even (tragically) die,\u201d Morse said. Lingering and Long-Term Effects Not much is known about how frequently COVID-19 patients suffer long-term effects, but there are signs that the disease does not always completely resolve itself as rapidly as expected \u2014 and is unlikely to be described as \u201charmless\u201d by many who are affected. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any long-term data because the virus has only been around for a little while,\u201d said Harvard\u2019s Jha. \u201cBut we certainly are seeing more and more cases of people with \u2026 lingering symptoms.\u201d According to the WHO, it takes about two weeks for a person to recover from a mild case of COVID-19, and three to six weeks to recover from a severe or critical one. Anecdotally, however, some patients \u2014 even those with mild cases \u2014 report months of extreme fatigue or on-and-off again symptoms such as headaches , brain fog or shortness of breath that make daily life difficult. These so-called \u201clong-haulers,\u201d as some call themselves, have shared their stories in online support groups and with journalists . One patient in the U.K. told The Atlantic that her case might be \u201cmild relative to dying in a hospital, but this virus has ruined my life.\u201d Without more data, it\u2019s difficult to know how common these complaints are or why they might be happening, but similar types of symptoms have\n\u2014 suggest an infection fatality rate of 1.2%, as Jha explained in a Twitter thread . Based on several studies in various countries, the World Health Organization\u2019s chief scientist, Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, said on July 2 that the infection fatality rate is about 0.6% \u2014 at least for now, according to the New York Times . Jha said he thinks the rate \u201cshould come down over time because we\u2019re getting better at treating COVID.\u201d \u201cAnd so somebody who spends three weeks in the ICU, has severe lung damage and would have died two months ago might now survive,\u201d he said. \u201cBut let\u2019s be very clear, that if you spent three weeks in the ICU, have severe, diffuse lung damage and you survive, it\u2019s fabulous that you survived. That was not inconsequential.\u201d Even if the infection fatality rate is about 1%, that\u2019s \u201cstill a lot of people,\u201d Dr. Lee Riley , professor and chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us. \u201c I\u2019m more concerned about the actual numbers of people who are dying rather than the percent.\u201d As of July 6, that figure was 130,208 deaths in the United States , according to Johns Hopkins\u2019 figures. \u201cWhatever the proportion, we\u2019ve had over 130,000 deaths in the US so far,\u201d Morse, at Columbia University, said, \u201cmore than twice as many as died in the Vietnam War, and more than died in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan combined, but I don\u2019t think war could be called \u201899% harmless\u2019.\u201d McEnany said in the July 6 press briefing that Trump\u2019s claim was a reference to \u201cthe fact that mortality in this country is very low.\u201d And the case \u201cfatality rate in this country, vis-a-vis other European countries, is much lower than, let\u2019s say, France and Italy.\u201d The U.S., at 4.5%, does have a lower case fatality rate than France (14.6%) and Italy (14.4%), as well as other countries, but a higher rate than many countries, too. But McEnany\u2019s explanation doesn\u2019t support what Trump said, in claiming 99% of coronavirus cases are \u201ctotally harmless.\u201d In addition to those who die, many are hospitalized. In June, the CDC published data on the 1.3 million reported cases in the U.S. from Jan. 22 to May 30, finding: \u201cOverall, 184,673 (14%) patients were hospitalized, 29,837 (2%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and\nis obvious \u2013 there is a pandemic of a new virus that is putting a huge and sudden strain on healthcare systems. \u2018You can call it a germ, you can call it a flu, you can call it a virus, you know you can call it many different names. I\u2019m not sure anybody even knows what it is\u2019 On 27 March, Trump made the above claim despite warnings from public health experts that coronavirus should not be conflated with seasonal flu. Fauci, for example, has said that Covid-19 is transferred between people far more easily than the flu and has a mortality rate around 10 times higher. While there was initial confusion over coronavirus when Chinese authorities described it as an unusual form of pneumonia, the world has been well aware of the dimensions of the virus since January, when China acknowledged the severity of the condition and released the genetic information of Covid-19.

But Trump wasn\u2019t lying; Biden had made statements about his climate policies that critics interpreted as voicing support for a fracking prohibition. Some of those remarks are included in a campaign video that Trump has shown at recent rallies in West Salem, Wisconsin ; Circleville, Ohio ; and Martinsburg and Lititz, Pennsylvania . And some of the edited clips in that video leave out important context. To start, in the section of the video titled \u201cBiden Will Ban Fracking,\u201d it shows CNN\u2019s Dana Bash asking Biden at a July 2019 Democratic candidates debate, \u201cWould there be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking, in a Biden administration?\u201d In the Trump video, Biden answers: \u201cNo, we would \u2014 we would work it out. We would make sure it\u2019s eliminated.\u201d \u201cJoe Biden is committed to achieving a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions by 2050,\u201d his campaign said in a statement clarifying his remarks the night of that debate. \u201cHe supports eliminating subsidies for coal and gas and deploying carbon capture sequestration technology to create economic benefits for multiple industries and significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions.\u201d Next, the video shows a clip of Biden telling an environmental activist in September 2019, \u201cI guarantee you, we\u2019re going to end fossil fuel,\u201d which includes oil and gas. Then, it transitions to a video of Biden from a March 15 debate with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \u201cNo more \u2013 no new fracking,\u201d Biden says in the clip. Not shown in Trump\u2019s video is that Biden went on to say \u201cno more drilling on federal lands,\u201d which is closer to what his energy plan says. His campaign also said that night that he only meant no new permits for oil and gas drilling on federal land and offshore. After that, the video shows Biden telling CNBC in May , \u201cI\u2019d gradually move away from fracking.\u201d But Biden was even more emphatic about not banning all fracking in that interview , in which he said: \u201cThe whole idea of whether or not we\u2019re going to stop fracking, I would not stop fracking. I\u2019d gradually move away from fracking. I would just not do more fracking on federal lands. I would gradually move us out of the position of relying on oil and gas, excuse me, and coal.\u201d That part isn\u2019t in the Trump campaign video.

Any attempt to shut down churches would face significant legal and public opposition, regardless of the political party in power.\n\n4. **Current Political Discourse**: While there may be individual Democrats who advocate for policies that could be perceived as limiting the influence of religion in public life, this does not reflect a party-wide agenda to eliminate churches. \n\n5. **Fact-Checking**: There is no credible evidence or official party platform that supports the claim that the Democratic Party wants to permanently shut down churches. Such a claim would likely be considered hyperbolic or a misrepresentation of the party's actual policies and intentions.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the statement is not supported by factual evidence and appears to be an exaggeration of the Democratic Party's stance on church and state issues.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 0, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.2}

The Multnomah County Sheriff\u2019s Office has even had to remove checkpoints set up by residents who had been forcing cars to stop. Photographers and journalists have been accused of being arsonists and looters, and have been threatened and even held at gunpoint as a result.

The misinformation appears to be part of a global trend in which climate change deniers have scapegoated arsonists \u2014 and not a warming planet \u2014 as the cause of blazes from Oregon to Australia. During the fires across large swaths of eastern Australia in January, prominent right-wing social media figures elevated the false claim that nearly 200 people had been arrested for intentionally starting the blazes. Some conspiracy theories have even gone as far as to baselessly accuse climate change activists of igniting the flames as a sort of false flag. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro blamed Leonardo DiCaprio and environmental NGOs for starting fires in the Amazon last year. To be sure, arsonists do exist, driven by criminal intention, compulsion, or both.

{"claim": "Controversial abortion methods are allowed under New Zealand's Abortion Legislation Act (2020).", "label": "Refuted", "result": {"response": "To assess the factual accuracy of the statement regarding New Zealand's Abortion Legislation Act (2020), we need to analyze the relevant aspects of the law based on the provided knowledge.\n\n1. **Understanding the Abortion Legislation Act (2020)**: This act was introduced in New Zealand to reform the country's abortion laws. It decriminalized abortion and allowed for greater access to abortion services. Under this legislation, abortions can be performed up to 20 weeks of pregnancy without the need for a specific reason. After 20 weeks, abortions can still be performed, but they require the approval of two medical practitioners who must agree that the abortion is appropriate in the circumstances.\n\n2. **Controversial Methods**: The term \"controversial abortion methods\" could refer to various procedures that may be debated in terms of ethics, safety, or societal acceptance. The act itself does not specify which methods are considered controversial, but it does allow for medical and surgical abortions, which can include methods that some may find contentious.\n\n3. **Public Perception and Debate**: The act has been subject to public discussion and differing opinions, particularly regarding the ethical implications of late-term abortions and the methods used. However, the law itself is designed to provide access to abortion services rather than to endorse or restrict specific methods.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The statement claims that \"controversial abortion methods are allowed\" under the act. Given that the act allows for various methods of abortion, including those that may be considered controversial by some, the statement can be interpreted as true. However, it is essential to note that the act does not explicitly endorse any controversial methods; it simply provides a legal framework for abortion services.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement is accurate.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"True\"\n}\n```", "answer": "True"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "her death. Other similarly tragic stories are sure to emerge once state review committees begin to publicize their findings, which operate with a lag. MYTH #4: Depending on who is elected, there will be a federal law either banning or legalizing abortion nationwide. REALITY : It is highly unlikely the election will change the composition of Congress enough to give either party sufficient votes to pass a federal law either banning or legalizing abortion nationwide. Vice President Harris has consistently supported abortion rights over the course of her political career . As the Democratic presidential nominee, Harris has said she supports legislation that would restore the protections established by Roe v. Wade . She has not answered the question about whether she opposes any restrictions on abortion. Under Roe v. Wade , states could only restrict abortion after the point of fetal viability, or about 22 weeks of pregnancy, except in cases where abortions were necessary to protect the life or health of the pregnant person. Former President Trump\u2019s position on a national abortion ban has wavered significantly over time. As president, Trump supported a 2018 bill that would have banned abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy nationwide. Earlier this year, Trump signaled support for a 16-week and then a 15-week abortion ban. His current position is that the legality of abortion should be left to the states. During the presidential debate against Vice President Harris, Trump declined to say whether he would veto a national ban if he were reelected. To enact legislation that would protect or ban abortion nationwide, the party that won the presidency would also need to secure majorities in both the House and Senate. All three are shaping up to be tight races. Because it is highly unlikely either party will secure sufficient support in this election, including the 60 votes needed to overcome the Senate filibuster , neither will be able to pass a federal law codifying abortion policy nationwide. This means those in favor of protecting reproductive rights need to do so through the kind of measures that will be on the ballot in many states. MYTH #5: Women living in states where abortion is legal will not be affected by the outcome of the 2024 election. REALITY: Federal regulation, largely determined by executive agencies operating under the authority of the president, plays a major role in determining access to abortion. In recent\nof abortion policy in their state (45%), how to obtain an abortion if they need one in the near future (26%), or that people in their state can get medication abortion pills online (19%). Since Roe v. Wade was overturned, the landscape involving abortion bans and restrictions at the state level has been shifting rapidly. The survey also explores the abortion experiences and perspectives of women in Florida \u2014where it is on the ballot this November\u2014and Arizona , a swing state that may have an abortion ballot initiative this fall. Nearly one in five (18%) reproductive-age women in Florida report they have had an abortion. Among women of reproductive-age in Arizona, 15% say they have had an abortion at some point in their lives. Seven in 10 women in Arizona (70%) and Florida (72%) say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Additional findings include: In Florida, only one in five (18%) are aware medication abortion is still legal in their state (abortion is available until six weeks in Florida). About a third (34%) don\u2019t know where to get an abortion or where to find the information should they need one, and only one in ten (9%) are aware that medication abortion pills can be obtained online. Awareness is similarly limited in Arizona (where abortion is currently available up to 15 weeks), particularly among women with lower incomes who are affected disproportionately by restrictions on abortion, have lower awareness about abortion access in their state, and have more significant concerns about pregnancy safety. The fallout from the overturning of Roe v. Wade has resulted in a substantial number of women who report struggling themselves\u2014or knowing someone who struggled\u2014to get an abortion. Nearly one in ten (8%) women of reproductive age in the United States personally know someone, including themselves, who has had difficulty getting an abortion since Roe v. Wade was overturned, including 11% of Hispanic women and 13% of women living in states with abortion bans. Among the barriers cited were traveling out of state for care, not knowing where to go, and lacking the money to cover the cost. Across the United States, 17% of reproductive-age women report changing their contraceptive practices as a result of Roe v. Wade being overturned. Actions taken include starting birth control, getting a sterilization procedure, switching to a more effective method, or purchasing emergency contraceptive pills to have on hand.\nbecoming pregnant and increased access to contraception rather than by laws restricting abortions, said Elizabeth Nash, the institute\u2019s senior state policy manager. \"Between 2011 and 2017, the abortion decline appears to be driven by fewer people becoming pregnant in the first place, as both abortions and births declined. If abortion restrictions were the main driver across the board, we\u2019d expect the birth rate to increase,\" Nash said. \"There are a lot of potential factors at play, including increased access to affordable contraception (due to the Affordable Care Act among other policies that make it easier to afford contraception), new methods of contraception, and changing pregnancy desires and attitudes.\" Our ruling A Facebook post shares a graph on U.S. abortion rates and says the larger declines during recent Democratic presidential administrations is due to the party\u2019s approach of making abortions unnecessary, rather than the Repbulican party\u2019s approach of making them illegal. The graphs cites CDC data, but health department reporting on abortions has fluctuated so much over the years that making broad comparisons can prove challenging. Not every state has reported its abortion data for every year. Moreover, experts said tying the abortion rate to the occupant of the White House alone is an oversimplification of a variety of factors that are at play. We rate this claim Half True.

(In this article , Care Net addresses the \u201ccontraception mentality\u201d of Planned Parenthood.) This is helpful information from Abort73 : Is contraception really the best way to prevent abortion? Would there actually be more abortions if Planned Parenthood didn't exist? After all, Planned Parenthood declares on its website that it prevents 560,000 unintended pregnancies a year, and the Guttmacher Institute tells us that 40% of unintended pregnancies are aborted. Do we say then that Planned Parenthood is preventing a quarter-million abortions each year? We certainly do not! These are hypothetical saves; they pale in comparison to the millions of living human beings who've already been torn to pieces by Planned Parenthood. In a 2010 report examining contraceptive use in the United States over the last 30 years, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reaches this conclusion: Contraceptive use in the United States is virtually universal among women of reproductive age\u2026 But that does not mean that contraceptive use in the United States is completely consistent or effective. One-half of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended, and the average probability of an unintended pregnancy in 12 months of contraceptive use in the United States is 12%, unchanged from 1995. Ann Furedi, the chief executive of the largest independent abortion provider in the UK, had this to say about birth control in a 2008 London debate : \u201cWe live in a society where we know contraception fails. In the real world, out of women who are using the pill well, about 8 in every 100 will get pregnant in the course of a year.\u201d The World Health Organization (WHO) adds the following: \u201cEven if all contraceptive users were to use methods perfectly all the time, there would still be nearly six million accidental pregnancies annually. Thus, even with high rates of contraceptive use, (millions of) unwanted pregnancies will occur.\u201d This is the dirty little secret of birth control. It only works most of the time . What does that mean on the average university campus? Consider the University of Minnesota. In 2007, the UM Boynton Health Service surveyed 10,000 college students throughout the state . Seventy-two percent indicated they were sexually active during the last year.

For this and other reasons, it is critical that the public be informed about the issue. Here are five myths about abortion in America, compared to the reality. MYTH #1: Many women are having abortions in the third trimester of pregnancy, including in the ninth month or later.

So-called \u201clate-term abortions\u201d performed at or after 21 weeks of pregnancy are extremely uncommon and represent less than 1% of all abortions in the U.S. They generally occur because of the discovery of a fatal condition affecting the fetus or serious risks to the life or health of the mother.

The tool was announced in May 2019 and instructed users that it was for \u201cinformation gathering only.\u201d The web page now says it \u201cisn\u2019t accepting new responses.\u201d Trump has continued to talk about the issue, though. \u201cThe Radical Left is in total command & control of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Google,\u201d he wrote on Twitter on May 16. \u201cThe Administration is working to remedy this illegal situation.

This is a specific percentage that suggests a significant portion of the student population.\n\n2. **Contextual Data**: According to various educational and demographic reports, Spanish is indeed one of the most commonly spoken languages in the United States, particularly among children. However, the exact percentage can vary based on the source and the year of the data.\n\n3. **Recent Statistics**: As of the latest data available up to October 2023, estimates suggest that around 20% of students in US public schools are English Language Learners (ELLs), with a significant portion of these students speaking Spanish. However, the percentage of all students (including native speakers) who speak Spanish at home or in school settings may be higher.\n\n4. **Comparative Analysis**: While 24% is a plausible figure, it is essential to verify if it is the most accurate representation of the current statistics. Reports from the U.S. Census Bureau and educational institutions often cite figures around 20% to 25% for Spanish speakers among school-aged children, but the exact number can fluctuate.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given that the statement claims a specific percentage (24%), and considering the estimates generally range around that figure, the statement can be considered reasonably accurate. However, without precise data confirming that exactly 24% is the current figure, it is safer to conclude that the statement is not definitively true.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"True\"\n}\n```", "answer": "True"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 0, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.2}
{"claim": "Former US vice-president Joe Biden is showing pretty severe signs of dementia.", "label": "Refuted", "result": {"response": "To assess the factual accuracy of the statement regarding Joe Biden showing severe signs of dementia, we need to analyze the provided knowledge points.\n\n1. **Cognitive Test Reference**: The knowledge mentions an interaction where Joe Biden was asked if he had taken a cognitive test. His response was defensive, indicating he did not see the need for such a test. This could imply he is aware of his cognitive state and does not believe he has issues that would necessitate testing for dementia.\n\n2. **Age and Public Perception**: The knowledge points out that Biden is nearing 78 years old, which is a factor often associated with concerns about cognitive decline. However, it does not provide any direct evidence of dementia or severe cognitive impairment.\n\n3. **Public Statements and Behavior**: Biden's comments about looking forward to debates and his interactions with the media suggest he is engaged and aware, which counters the claim of severe dementia.\n\n4. **Hunter Biden's Reflections**: The knowledge includes Hunter Biden's reflections on grief and family dynamics, but it does not provide any evidence regarding Joe Biden's mental health or cognitive abilities.\n\n5. **Political Context**: The mention of Trump using Biden's age and mental state as a political tactic indicates that there is a narrative being pushed regarding Biden's cognitive abilities, but this does not confirm the presence of dementia.\n\nIn summary, while there are concerns about Biden's age and cognitive health, the knowledge provided does not substantiate the claim that he is showing severe signs of dementia. The evidence leans more towards him being engaged and aware rather than exhibiting severe cognitive decline.\n\nBased on this analysis, the conclusion is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "his characteristic humanity as he greeted familiar faces with a broad smile, a lingering hug or a fond memory of his son.

This includes deaths from various causes, such as firearms-related incidents and traffic-related incidents. \n\n2. **COVID-19 Impact**: The knowledge does not provide specific data on officer deaths due to COVID-19. However, it is widely reported that during the pandemic, many law enforcement officers, like other essential workers, faced significant risks from COVID-19.

It was part of the Force Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (FCIID), headed by the then Deputy Inspector General of Police Anthony Ogbizi . [ 1 ] SARS was controversial for its links to extrajudicial killings , forced disappearances , extortion , torture , framing , blackmail , kidnapping , illegal organ trade , armed robbery , home invasions , rape of men and women, child arrests, the invasion of privacy , and polluting bodies of water with the illegal disposal of human remains. SARS was investigated several times in response to protests, but without results; reforms were promised in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019.

[ 4 ] [ 5 ] History [ edit ] The Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) was founded in late 1992 by former police commissioner Simeon Danladi Midenda . The inciting events that spurred SARS formation were the killing of Colonel Ezra Dindam Rimdan ( Nigerian Army ) by police officers at a checkpoint in Lagos in September 1992, their arrest, [ 6 ] a strike by police officers in response, and a subsequent crime wave.

This suggests a drastic decline in the population of bison, attributing this decline specifically to the actions of colonizers.\n\n2. **Key Points from Knowledge**:\n   - North American bison, also known as buffalo, once roamed the continent in vast herds.\n   - Their population faced a significant decline due to various factors, including hunting, habitat loss, and the impact of colonization.\n   - Historical records indicate that by the late 19th century, the bison population had plummeted to a critically low number, but it is important to verify the specific figure of twenty-seven individuals.\n\n3. **Historical Context**: \n   - The bison population was indeed reduced to very low numbers, with estimates suggesting that by the end of the 1800s, the population had dropped to a few hundred individuals, not just twenty-seven.\n   - Conservation efforts in the 20th century have led to a recovery of the bison population, with numbers now in the hundreds of thousands across North America.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The claim that the number of North American bison was reduced to only twenty-seven individuals is inaccurate. While the population did decline drastically due to colonization and other factors, it did not reach such a critically low number as twenty-seven. \n\nBased on this reasoning, the statement is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 0, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.2}

The knowledge mentions that the Trump administration made a proactive decision to limit travel from China in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This indicates that there were measures taken to restrict travel, but it does not explicitly state that all travel was suspended.\n\n2. The context suggests that while there were significant restrictions on travel from China, it is important to clarify what \"suspended all travel\" means. Typically, a complete suspension would imply that no travel is allowed, which may not be the case if there were exceptions or if some travel was still permitted under certain conditions.\n\n3. The knowledge does not provide specific details about the extent of the travel restrictions, such as whether they were total or partial, or if there were exceptions for certain categories of travelers (e.g., U.S. citizens, permanent residents, or essential workers).\n\nGiven these points, the statement appears to be an oversimplification.

Purpose . The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which originated in the People\u2019s Republic of China, continues to pose a significant threat to the health of Americans throughout the United States. As we have since January 2020, with the proactive decision to limit travel from China and the passage of three massive economic relief packages, my Administration will take whatever steps are necessary to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and maintain economic prosperity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the Department of Health and Human Services have concluded that \u201cgrowing and disproportionate unemployment rates for some racial and ethnic minority groups during the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to greater risk of eviction and homelessness or sharing of housing.\u201d This trend is concerning for many reasons, including that homeless shelters have proven to be particularly susceptible to outbreaks of COVID-19. CDC has observed that \u201c[h]omelessness poses multiple challenges that can exacerbate and amplify the spread of COVID-19. Homeless shelters are often crowded, making social distancing difficult. Many persons experiencing homelessness are older or have underlying medical conditions, placing them at higher risk for severe COVID-19\u2013associated illness.\u201d Increased shared housing is also potentially problematic to the extent it results in increased in-person interactions between older, higher-risk individuals and their younger relatives or friends. My Administration has taken bold steps to help renters and homeowners have safe and secure places to call home during the COVID-19 crisis. Prior to passage of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) (Public Law 116-136), the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development implemented a foreclosure and eviction moratorium for all single-family mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. Furthermore, prior to passage of the CARES Act, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) announced that it had instructed the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (the Enterprises) to suspend foreclosures for at least 60 days. FHFA has since announced that the\ndegrees Celsius, and then \u2026 there\u2019s no way back.\u201d Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees would reduce the damages and losses of global warming, but scientists agree that climate action is still possible after passing the threshold. Trump said immigrants crossing the border illegally were living in \u201cluxury hotels.\u201d New York City has provided hotel and motel rooms to migrant families, but there is no evidence that they are being placed in \u201cluxury\u201d hotels. Trump falsely claimed that there was \u201cno terrorism, at all\u201d in the U.S. during his administration. There were several terrorist acts carried out by foreign-born individuals when he was president. While talking about international trade, Trump falsely claimed that the U.S. currently has \u201cthe largest deficit with China.\u201d In 2023, the trade deficit in goods and services with China was the lowest it has been since 2009. Trump wrongly claimed that prior to the pandemic, he had created \u201cthe greatest economy in the history of our country.\u201d That\u2019s far from true using economists\u2019 preferred measure \u2014 growth in gross domestic product. As he has many times before, Trump wrongly claimed, \u201cI gave you the largest tax cut in history.\u201d That\u2019s not true either as a percentage of gross domestic product or in inflation-adjusted dollars. Trump contrasted his administration with Biden\u2019s by misleadingly noting that when he left office, the U.S. was \u201cenergy independent.\u201d The U.S. continues to export more energy than it imports. The debate was hosted by CNN in Atlanta on June 27. Analysis Social Security Biden claimed that Trump \u201cwants to get rid\u201d of Social Security, even though the former president has consistently said he will not cut the program and has advised Republicans against doing so. Biden and Trump on stage at the first presidential debate of the 2024 election hosted by CNN in Atlanta. Photo by Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images. Earlier this year, Biden and his campaign based the claim on Trump saying in a March 11 CNBC interview that \u201cthere is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements in terms of cutting and in terms of also the theft and the bad management of entitlements.\u201d As we\u2019ve said , in context, instead of reducing benefits, Trump was talking about cutting waste and fraud in those programs \u2014 although there\u2019s not enough of that to make the program solvent over the long term. \u201cI will never do anything that\nBeijing gave material support for Russia\u2019s war, and the US government believes that red line has not been crossed in the months since. As a co-equal branch of government, the US executive has little control over congressional travel. China has grown more powerful militarily and economically since Gingrich\u2019s visit in 1997 and some analysts worry such a trip by Pelosi at a time of fraught ties could spur a crisis across the 100-mile (160km)-wide Taiwan strait. Ali Wyne, a senior analyst at Eurasia Group and the author of America\u2019s Great-Power Opportunity, said the two leaders\u2019 call would at least serve to reinforce the imperative of avoiding miscalculations over Taiwan. He said: \u201cThe consequences of a military confrontation between Washington and Beijing would be that much more devastating against the backdrop of a grinding war in eastern Europe and a fragile recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d Reuters contributed to this report Explore more on these topics China Xi Jinping Joe Biden Taiwan Asia Pacific Biden administration Nancy Pelosi news Share Reuse this content More on this story More on this story Trump says \u2018very dangerous\u2019 for UK to do business with China, after Starmer hails progress in Beijing Trump is making China \u2013 not America \u2013 great again, global survey suggests Five key takeaways from Donald Trump\u2019s meeting with Xi Jinping Trump-Xi meeting: US president says rare earths deal and tariff cut agreed China accuses US of \u2018seriously violating\u2019 trade truce China condemns US decision to revoke student visas Trump claims \u2018total reset\u2019 of US-China ties as 90-day pause to trade war agreed Chinese and US officials meet in Geneva for \u2018de-escalation\u2019 trade talks US forges ahead with plans for steep port fees on China-built vessels China condemns \u2018unilateral bullying\u2019 as it calls on US to drop tariffs Most viewed Most viewed\nFacebook Posts Distort Facts on Trump Actions - FactCheck.org Facebook Twitter Tumblr Close Skip to main content FactCheck .org \u00ae A Project of The Annenberg Public Policy Center Quick Take Facebook posts credit President Donald Trump with accomplishing a list of things that haven\u2019t happened \u2014 claiming, for example, that he \u201ccancelled\u201d a proposed House bill on contact tracing and \u201cexpelled WHO.\u201d Full Story Popular text posts circulating on Facebook, in some cases with explicit references to the QAnon conspiracy theory , are falsely claiming that President Donald Trump has accomplished things that haven\u2019t actually happened. \u201cIn just a couple of days, Donald Trump did what many of us expected and knew would happen,\u201d the posts claim, proceeding to a list of six purported actions by the president. But most of the claims are false, misleading or unsupported. Others require a bit more context. We\u2019ll break them down here. Claim: Trump \u201cCancelled the Democrats HR 6666 bill, known as the Covid 19 TRACE Act that was the basis for Bill Gates\u2019s diagnosis and tracking project, which was also cancelled.\u201d First of all, there\u2019s no evidence that H.R. 6666 \u2014 the COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act \u2014 is a \u201cbasis\u201d for a purported \u201ctracking project\u201d by Bill Gates. The bill outlines a $100 billion fund to be managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in order to fund contact tracing efforts across the country, as we\u2019ve previously explained . Secondly, the president doesn\u2019t have the power to \u201ccancel\u201d a bill. Instead, he could veto a piece of legislation if it were to come to his desk. But the bill in question is far from that step: H.R. 6666 is currently before a House committee. It would need to advance to the House floor and be passed by that chamber, as well as by the Republican-led Senate, before it would go to Trump.

The new financial support comes as the government places a legal requirement on people to self-isolate when instructed to by NHS Test and Trace and the introduction of higher fines for breaking the rules: \u201cPeople will be required by law to self-isolate from 28 September, supported by payment of \u00a3500 for those on lower incomes who cannot work from home and have lost income as a result. New fines for those breaching self-isolation rules will start at \u00a31,000 \u2013 bringing this in line with the penalty for breaking quarantine after international travel - but could increase to up to \u00a310,000 for repeat offences and for the most egregious breaches, including for those preventing others from self-isolating.\u201d Local Authorities will set up these self-isolation support schemes, we expected to be in place by 12 October. Those who start to self-isolate from 28 September will receive backdated payments once the scheme is set up in their Local Authority. The eligibility criteria for the \u00a3500 payment are contained in updated Pubic Health England\u00a0guidance - Stay at home guidance for households with possible or confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19) infection - that says: \u201cYou will be eligible if you live in England and meet all the following criteria - you have been asked to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace you are employed or self-employed you cannot work from home and will lose income as a result you are claiming at least one of the following benefits: universal credit, working tax credit, income-related employment and support allowance, income-based jobseeker\u2019s allowance, income support, pension credit or housing benefit.'

The income estimates in the main sections of this report are based on the concept of money income, which is pretax and does not account for the value of in-kind transfers. Appendix A provides a detailed explanation of how income is measured using the CPS ASEC. Estimates of post-tax income and inequality are included in Appendix B. Income in the United States: 2023 [<1.0 MB] Highlights Real median household income was $80,610 in 2023, a 4.0 percent increase from the 2022 estimate of $77,540 (Figure 1 and Table A-1). This is the first statistically significant annual increase in real median household income since 2019. Real median household incomes increased by 5.4 percent for White households and by 5.7 percent for non-Hispanic White households between 2022 and 2023. There was no significant change in median incomes for Black, Asian, and Hispanic households (Figure 2 and Table A-1). Household income rose throughout the income distribution, increasing 6.7 percent at the 10th percentile and 4.6 percent at the 90th percentile (Table A-3). Income inequality as measured by the Gini index and income percentile ratios was not significantly different between 2022 and 2023 (Figure 3 and Table A-3). Between 2022 and 2023, the number of total workers increased by 2.2 million, or 1.3 percent. The change in the number of full-time, year-round workers was not statistically significant (Figure 5 and Table A-6). Real median earnings for men who worked full-time, year-round increased by 3.0 percent, and real median earnings increased 1.5 percent for women who worked full-time, year-round (Figure 4 and Table A-6). For full-time, year-round workers, the female-to-male earnings ratio in 2023 fell to 82.7 percent from 84.0 percent in 2022 (Figure 6 and Table A-6). This is the first statistically significant annual decrease in the female-to-male earnings ratio since 2003. Tables Income: Table A-1.

Here are a few lessons the average person can take away from it. Henglein and Steets / Getty Images Building Wealth Takes Time First, consider how long it took for Biden to become a millionaire. He began his career in 1968 and likely didn\u2019t reach millionaire status for two decades. It\u2019s a good reminder that building a fortune takes time. Instead of trying to get rich quickly, you\u2019re often better off taking the methodical route. Practically, that means consistently spending less than you earn and allocating savings to smart investments. The most realistic path to wealth for the majority of people is investing in the S&P 500, according to financial experts like Warren Buffet and Mark Cuban . It returns an average of around 10.26% . That can add up to quite a bit throughout your life. For example, say you invest $20,000 into the S&P today. Then, you continue investing $1,000 monthly for the next 30 years. You\u2019d end up with over $2.5 million from just $360,000 in contributions. This shows how time creates wealth when you invest well. SrdjanPav / iStock.com The Power of Resiliency Biden\u2019s story is also a good lesson in the power of resiliency. He\u2019s experienced some of the highest highs that a person can because he never gave up during his lowest lows. For example, Biden lost his wife and daughter just after winning his first Senate election. He lost his first presidential primary to Michael Dukakis in 1987"}], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 5, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.2}

In fact, the CDC stopped tracking flu activity early for the 2019-2020 season because COVID-19 precautions wiped out the flu. The flu was virtually nonexistent for the 2020-2021 season likely because people were wearing masks, staying home more often, and not socializing. Now that flu and COVID-19 are spreading at the same time, flu deaths may sadly rise again. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to get vaccinated, get tested, and wear masks to prevent both viruses. Flu is Still Serious Just because flu mortality is lower than COVID-19 mortality doesn\u2019t mean flu isn\u2019t serious. CDC estimates that flu has resulted in 9 million \u2013 41 million illnesses, 140,000 \u2013 710,000 hospitalizations, and 12,000 \u2013 52,000 deaths annually between 2010 and 2020.

Several prior studies have calculated excess deaths in the United States but were limited to the national or state level, precluding an examination of area-level variation in excess mortality and excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19. In this study, we take advantage of county-level variation in COVID-19 mortality to estimate excess deaths associated with the pandemic and examine how the extent of excess mortality not assigned to COVID-19 varies across subsets of counties defined by sociodemographic and health characteristics. Methods and findings In this ecological, cross-sectional study, we made use of provisional National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) data on direct COVID-19 and all-cause mortality occurring in US counties from January 1 to December 31, 2020 and reported before March 12, 2021. We used data with a 10-week time lag between the final day that deaths occurred and the last day that deaths could be reported to improve the completeness of data. Our sample included 2,096 counties with 20 or more COVID-19 deaths. The total number of residents living in these counties was 319.1 million. On average, the counties were 18.7% Hispanic, 12.7% non-Hispanic Black, and 59.6% non-Hispanic White. A total of 15.9% of the population was older than 65 years. We first modeled the relationship between 2020 all-cause mortality and COVID-19 mortality across all counties and then produced fully stratified models to explore differences in this relationship among strata of sociodemographic and health factors. Overall, we found that for every 100 deaths assigned to COVID-19, 120 all-cause deaths occurred (95% CI, 116 to 124), implying that 17% (95% CI, 14% to 19%) of excess deaths were ascribed to causes of death other than COVID-19 itself. Our stratified models revealed that the percentage of excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19 was substantially higher among counties with lower median household incomes and less formal education, counties with poorer health and more diabetes, and counties in the South and West. Counties with more non-Hispanic Black residents, who were already at high risk of COVID-19 death based on direct counts, also reported higher percentages of excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19. Study\nStudy finds that despite broad COVID vaccine availability, COVID still deadlier than flu in hospitalized patients | CIDRAP Study finds that despite broad COVID vaccine availability, COVID still deadlier than flu in hospitalized patients News brief Laine Bergeson Topics COVID-19 Influenza, General Share Copied to clipboard KatarzynaBialasiewicz / iStock While the mortality gap between COVID-19 and influenza has narrowed since the onset of the pandemic, COVID continues to carry a substantially higher short-term risk of death than seasonal flu despite the availability of a COVID vaccine, according to a large population-based cohort study from South Korea. For the study, published last week in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases , Korean researchers drew on data from national health insurance claims to compare 30-day all-cause mortality among more than 15 million people diagnosed as having COVID or influenza from July 2022 to December 2023. 76% higher odds of death by 30 days for COVID A COVID diagnosis was associated with 76% higher odds of death within 30 days than influenza. Overall, 0.20% of patients with COVID died, compared with 0.016% of those with influenza, a roughly 12.5-fold difference in crude mortality. Among hospitalized patients, COVID was linked to a substantially greater risk of death in those receiving mechanical ventilation (1.88-fold higher). The mortality gap was especially pronounced among adults aged 18 to 64 years (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.93), hospitalized patients (aOR, 2.55), and those who had a heart attack (aOR, 2.24), chronic lung disease (aOR, 1.94), or diabetes (aOR, 1.81). Adults aged 65 and older also had increased risk, though the relative odds were lower than those of the 18- to 40-year cohort (aOR, 1.95). One possible explanation for the age-related differences, note the authors, is Korea\u2019s prioritization of COVID vaccines for older adults and those in high-risk groups. They also cite differences in coverage between the two vaccines and differences in vaccine uptake as contributing factors. Among adults 65 and older, uptake for influenza vaccines was 82.5% in 2023-24 but only 45% for COVID. \u201cThis disparity may have contributed to the higher mortality observed for COVID-19,\u201d the researchers write. \u201cCollectively, these findings highlight the critical role of vaccination coverage in shaping mortality patterns and underscore the need for targeted strategies to improve uptake among younger populations.\u201d European report calls on countries to update strategies on sexually transmitted infections News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Chlamydia Gonorrhea Sexually Transmitted Infections\nby G Kelly \u00b7 2021 \u00b7 Cited by 45 \u2014 The results show that published data on mortality from Covid-19 cannot be directly comparable across countries.\nfor Health Statistics, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

This tax is just the latest attempt by the Democrats to reshape the tax code and pass a tax on unrealized gains. This new tax is similar to the wealth taxes pushed by radical progressives such as Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). It would create a \u201cmark to market\u201d regime that would force Americans to pay taxes every year on the paper gain in the value of assets (i.e. stocks, collectibles, real estate). Currently, taxpayers only pay the capital gains tax when an asset is sold. This makes sense because the asset is illiquid until it is disposed of. This tax on unrealized gains would create a new tax system that requires taxpayers to pay tax on the value of an asset based on the value of these assets on a particular arbitrary date. It would empower the IRS, encourage taxpayers to move assets overseas, and could grow to hit millions of Americans over time. It would also harm the economy, impose retroactive taxation, and has failed everywhere it has been tried before. 5.

The budget proposes several new tax increases on high-income individuals and businesses, which combined with the BBBA would give the U.S. the highest top tax rates on individual and corporate income in the developed world : Raising the top marginal tax rate on individual income to 39.6 percent and applying an 8 percent surtax A surtax is an additional tax levied on top of an already existing business or individual tax and can have a flat or progressive rate structure. Surtaxes are typically enacted to fund a specific program or initiative, whereas revenue from broader-based taxes, like the individual income tax, typically cover a multitude of programs and services. on MAGI above $25 million would bring the combined top marginal tax rate on individual income to 57.3 percent, up from 42.9 percent under current law and above the OECD average of 42.6 percent. Taxing capital gains at ordinary income tax rates would bring the combined top marginal rate in the U.S. to 48.9 percent, up from 29.2 percent under current law and well-above the OECD average of 18.9 percent. Further, Biden\u2019s proposal for a complicated \u201c Billionaire Minimum Tax \u201d would bring unrealized gains into the tax base The tax base is the total amount of income, property, assets, consumption, transactions, or other economic activity subject to taxation by a tax authority. A narrow tax base is non-neutral and inefficient. A broad tax base reduces tax administration costs and allows more revenue to be raised at lower rates. on an annual basis, which is also out of step with international norms. Raising the corporate income tax A corporate income tax (CIT) is levied by federal and state governments on business profits. Many companies are not subject to the CIT because they are taxed as pass-through businesses, with income reportable under the individual income tax. rate to 28 percent would once again bring the U.S. near the top of the OECD a t a combined rate of 32.3 percent, versus 25.8 percent under current law and an OECD average (excluding the U.S.) of 22.8 percent.

In total, accounting for all provisions, including those estimated by OMB, we estimate the budget raises nearly $4.4 trillion in gross revenue from tax changes over the 11-year budget window. Expanded tax credits and the unspecified incentive to replace FDII reduce the gross revenue by $876 billion and $118 billion, resulting in a net tax increase of $3.4 trillion. Outside of tax changes, the budget includes additional spending increases and cost savings including expanding the drug pricing provisions passed in the Inflation Reduction Act for a net increase in spending of $1.2 trillion, summarized in Table 3. After accounting for all changes in revenue and spending, we estimate the net effect of the budget would be to reduce the deficit by about $2.1 trillion through 2034 on a conventional basis. On a dynamic basis, factoring in reduced tax revenues resulting from the smaller economy, the deficit reduction drops to $1.5 trillion. However, the projected decrease in budget deficits is highly uncertain. About $742 billion of the increased revenue comes from untested sources\u2014the 25 percent minimum tax on high earners and the UTPR.

This includes 11 tax increases on the oil and gas industry at a time when the price of gasoline is at record highs. It also includes tax increases on businesses that will give the U.S. a higher corporate tax rate than Communist China and other foreign rivals. However, this does not include all the tax increases being pushed by Democrats because this budget omits the cost of tax increases within their stalled Build Back Better Act. Instead of detailing these tax increases, the Biden budget includes a placeholder asserting that any new spending will be fully offset. As noted by Bloomberg, the administration\u2019s proposed spending plan would cost $1.75 trillion and included $2 trillion in tax increases. Here is the full list of tax increases in Biden\u2019s FY 23 budget: 1. Raise the corporate income tax rate to 28 percent: $1.3 trillion tax increase After accounting for state corporate taxes, Biden will give the U.S. a 32 percent corporate rate, a tax rate significantly higher than Communist China\u2019s 25 percent tax rate. This tax increase will be passed along to families in the form of higher prices of goods and services. For instance, a 2020 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that 31% of the corporate tax falls on consumers. Annual inflation increased by 7.9 percent in February, the highest reading in 40 years. Americans are seeing the price of energy, food, and transportation increase and this tax will only make this problem worse. In addition, a corporate tax increase will harm workers in the form of lower wages and fewer jobs. In a 2017 report, Stephen Entin of the Tax Foundation argued that 70% of corporate taxes are borne by labor. Other economists argue that anywhere from 20% to 50%, to even 100% of the tax hits workers. This tax increase won\u2019t just hit large businesses. 1.4 million small businesses organized as C-corporations will get hit by Biden\u2019s corporate tax rate hike, as noted by a study from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

A small proportion of primary care samples are also included in this reporting. In week 42, data is based on reporting from 9 out of the 14 sentinel laboratories. In week 42, 4,656 respiratory specimens reported through the Respiratory DataMart System were tested for influenza. There were 324 positive samples for influenza: 118 influenza A (not subtyped), 172 influenza A (H3N2), 30 influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, and 9 influenza B. Overall, influenza positivity remained stable at 7% in week 42 compared with 6.7% in the previous week.

Lowest activity for influenza: identified as weeks in a given year when, for at least two consecutive weeks, <2% of tests for influenza in those weeks are positive. Week 27 through Week 26 of the following calendar year was used to define a surveillance year in order to capture summer COVID-19 activity as the start of a given season. Lowest activity weeks for ARI were identified as weeks when COVID-19, influenza, and RSV were all identified as having low activity according to their separate thresholds. For each state within a region, the reference periods were used to calculate the values that created the levels (categories) for the 2025-2026 surveillance year. First, we calculated the weekly percentage of ED visits attributed to each pathogen and ARI overall within the identified lowest activity periods. Next, we calculated the mean, M, and standard deviation, S, attributed to each pathogen and ARI overall within the identified lowest activity periods. The mean was considered the baseline value for each state and was used as the top value for the Very Low category. Then, we computed the maximum number of standard deviations above the mean for any observed week over all weeks in the three previous seasons (N = maximum number of standard deviations = ( - M) / S). The maximum number of standard deviations (N) was divided by 4 and multiplied by the standard deviation (S = standard deviation). This value was denoted as D, so D = (N / 4) * S. Using X = percent of ED visits in a week for each pathogen and ARI overall, we classified activity levels as follows: Very Low: X <= M, activity at or below baseline Low: M < X <= M + D Moderate: M + D < X <= M + 2D High: M + 2D < X <= + 3D Very High: M + 3D < X Missouri: Due to data quality issues, Missouri's historical data before MMWR Week 10 of 2025 (March 2-8, 2025) could not be used for computing levels, thus leaving insufficient data.

Fauci, for example, has said that Covid-19 is transferred between people far more easily than the flu and has a mortality rate around 10 times higher. While there was initial confusion over coronavirus when Chinese authorities described it as an unusual form of pneumonia, the world has been well aware of the dimensions of the virus since January, when China acknowledged the severity of the condition and released the genetic information of Covid-19.

{"claim": "Transitioning to 100 per cent renewable electricity generation increase power prices in New Zealand", "label": "Refuted", "result": {"response": "To assess the factual accuracy of the statement \"Transitioning to 100 per cent renewable electricity generation increases power prices in New Zealand,\" we need to analyze the provided knowledge points.\n\n1. **Coal and Gas Consumption**: The knowledge indicates that coal consumption in New Zealand declined by 3% from 2018 to 2020, and gas-powered electricity generation also saw a decline. However, coal-powered electricity generation increased significantly (51.6%) during the same period, primarily due to lower hydroelectric generation and gas supply issues.\n\n2. **Impact of the Oil and Gas Exploration Ban**: The knowledge points out that the increase in coal-powered generation was not attributed to the oil and gas exploration ban. The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment noted that the increase in coal use was not a direct result of the ban, and that coal is expected to phase out due to the Emissions Trading Scheme.\n\n3. **Future of Energy in New Zealand**: The knowledge suggests that while coal may be used as a substitute for gas in the short term, it is unlikely to play a significant role in New Zealand's electricity sector in the long term. The transition to renewable energy sources is seen as necessary for a low-carbon economy.\n\n4. **Cost of Renewable Energy**: The knowledge does not explicitly state that transitioning to 100% renewable energy will increase power prices. In fact, it suggests that renewable solutions are becoming increasingly cheaper, which could imply that transitioning to renewables might not necessarily lead to higher prices.\n\nBased on these points, the statement that transitioning to 100% renewable electricity generation increases power prices in New Zealand lacks direct support from the provided knowledge. The knowledge suggests that renewable energy could potentially lower costs in the long run.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "June 2020 quarter (table 1). As the quarterly figures fluctuate a lot, AAP FactCheck also looked at annual figures. Figures for the year to June 2020 show coal consumption declined by three per cent between 2018 and 2020, from 1,157,243 tonnes to 1,153,579 tonnes. MBIE also reports quarterly on the make-up of New Zealand's electricity generation (table 1). Figures for the year to June show coal-powered electricity generation increased by 51.6 per cent between 2018 and 2020, from 1261GWh to 1912GWh. The figures also show gas-powered electricity generation declined by 10.3 per cent, from 6,354GWh in 2018 to 5,701GWh in 2020. However, MBIE's annual report on the energy sector said the increase in coal-powered generation was due to lower hydro electricity generation as the result of a dry year and maintenance at NZ's largest gas field, which reduced the supply of gas (page 14). \"Electricity generation from coal increased by 43 per cent in 2019,\" the report said. \"This was due to the need for non-renewable generation as a result of less favourable hydrological conditions, and gas outages meaning that there was less gas available for electricity generation use.\" (page 14) The report does not mention that the oil and gas exploration ban has had an impact on the supply of gas. It shows gas production is expected to increase in the near future before steadily declining (page 43, Fig E.7). The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment (PCE) investigated the impact of the government's oil and gas exploration ban and noted that the recent increase in coal-powered generation was \"not because of the ban\" (page 40). It found that, in future, a reduction in gas supply for electricity generation could result in more coal being used as it is currently the cheapest substitute (page 40). But it said \"coal is unlikely to play a role in New Zealand's electricity sector for much longer\" due to the Emissions Trading Scheme and coal being phased out by major generators (page 41). It found New Zealand's remaining gas reserves would probably be sufficient for intermittent electricity generation when hydro dams are low \"for several decades to come, albeit at a higher cost than at present\" (page 39). National Party energy and resources spokesperson Jonathan Young made similar claims about the government's oil and gas exploration ban in September which he later admitted was \"completely wrong\" .

National deputy leader Nicola Willis outlined during the campaign that climate adaptation will be a focus of this government . But it\u2019s not mentioned in the agreements once. By extension, climate adaptation can include market adaptation. That means embracing the change in the winds as renewable solutions become increasingly cheaper, not propping up old ideas in a sunset industry. Further proof the market is hardly free.

Their honest anxieties of providing for their wh\u0101nau are being unfairly taken advantage of here. Ultimately, this reversal is a waste of time and effort designed for short-term ostensible wins for the oil and gas sector. And they may not even come to pass.

Image by AP AAP FactCheck Investigation: Is New Zealand using more coal because of the government's offshore oil and gas exploration ban? The Statement \"The oil and gas exploration ban, what did that do, actually, our coal use has now gone up so now we've got more coal being used instead of natural gas to actually create electricity.\" Judith Collins, National Party leader, September 30, 2020. The Analysis National Party leader Judith Collins says the government's efforts to combat climate change have backfired and New Zealand is using more coal as a result of its offshore oil and gas exploration ban. In April 2018, the Labour-led government announced it would not issue any new permits for offshore oil and gas exploration . The policy became law in February 2019 . During the Newshub Leaders' Debate on September 30, Ms Collins said the policy had resulted in an increase in carbon emissions . (Video mark 1hr, 8min, 30secs). \"The oil and gas exploration ban, what did that do, actually our coal use has now gone up so now we've got more coal being used instead of natural gas to actually create electricity,\" Ms Collins said. AAP FactCheck examined Ms Collins statement that coal use had gone up and more coal is being used to generate electricity instead of gas, as a result of the government's offshore oil and gas exploration ban. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) publishes figures on coal consumption , which do not show an increase in coal consumption after the ban became law. Quarterly MBIE figures show coal consumption declined by 27 per cent between the December 2018 quarter - before the oil and gas exploration ban came into effect - and the June 2020 quarter (table 1). As the quarterly figures fluctuate a lot, AAP FactCheck also looked at annual figures. Figures for the year to June 2020 show coal consumption declined by three per cent between 2018 and 2020, from 1,157,243 tonnes to 1,153,579 tonnes.

The Yale -educated lawyer has held an array of positions at law firms, financial institutions, and lobbying firms that have raised questions about whether he has profited from his father\u2019s position. He has admitted to decades-long addictions to alcohol and cocaine. In 2023 the U.S. Justice Department named a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s conduct. The following year he was convicted of three federal felony charges that related to his purchase of a handgun while using narcotics in 2018. Also in 2024 he pleaded guilty to nine federal tax charges. However, in December 2024 Hunter Biden was pardoned by his father.

(more) Hunter Biden is the second of three children born to Joe Biden and his first wife, Neilia Hunter Biden. On December 18, 1972, Neilia Biden and infant daughter Naomi were killed in a car accident while on the way to pick out a Christmas tree . Hunter and his elder brother, Joseph Robinette (\u201c Beau \u201d) Biden III, who was known as Beau in the family, were critically injured. Among other injuries, Hunter suffered a broken skull and brain injuries. Joe Biden, who had been elected to the U.S. Senate six weeks earlier, took the oath of office in his sons\u2019 hospital room. In 1977 Joe Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs , who became Hunter and Beau\u2019s stepmother. Jill and Joe Biden have a daughter, Ashley Blazer Biden, who was born in 1981. Hunter Biden attended Archmere Academy, a Roman Catholic high school in Claymont, Delaware, following in the footsteps of his father and elder brother. He spent his first year of college at the University of Pennsylvania , then enrolled in Georgetown University in 1988, where he graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in history in 1992. After graduation, he moved on to Portland , Oregon , and he served in the Jesuit Volunteer Corps , where he met Kathleen Buhle. Three months into their relationship, Buhle became pregnant; the two were married in July 1993, and their daughter Naomi King Biden was born in December. They had two more daughters: Finnegan, born in 1998, and Maisy, born in 2000.

Mark Makela / Getty Images file In private conversations, the president has blamed himself for the fact that his son remains such a political target, telling associates it would not be happening if he were not in office and running for another term. Hunter Biden \u201ccomes up all the time,\u201d one source who has spoken with the president said, sometimes out of concern but also with pride at how he has endured the harsh spotlight recently. Not everyone in the West Wing, even at senior levels, knew what Hunter Biden would say Wednesday. But the president, who speaks with his son most days, if not multiple times each day, knew. And sources close to the president quickly praised the remarks as \u201cpowerful\u201d and \u201cforceful.\u201d Republicans have made \u201cwhere\u2019s Hunter\u201d a calling card of the 2024 race, with merchandise bearing the slogan.

Sensitive to the complaints Clinton faced as she tried to keep some of her speeches private, the Biden campaign made a point of saying that more than half his speaking engagements were open to the media. According to Biden\u2019s financial reports, his speaking fees were as high as $234,820 in one case. When Biden gave a lecture at Drew University in New Jersey in March 2018, he was paid $190,000. A couple of weeks later, he was paid $180,000 to speak at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. A Biden campaign official said the large speaking fees from universities came from special funds not linked to school tuition. Still, large fees from schools could be an issue at a time Biden and other candidates have made the rapid rise in the cost of attending college a major campaign issue. Biden may have avoided some of the landmines that hurt Clinton. While the details provided on the financial disclosures are vague for some of his events, there do not appear to be any checks collected from Wall Street investment banks or other big corporate interests. Overall, the documents showed the Bidens reported income of $396,456 in 2016, more than $11 million in 2017 and $4.6 million in 2018. The couple paid federal income tax at a rate of 23.5% in 2016, 33.9% in 2017 and 33.4% in 2018. Their charitable donations rose with their income: In 2016, the Bidens gave 1.5% of their income to charity; in 2017, they gave 9.2%; and in 2018, they donated 6%. Sizeable chunks of their donations went to nonprofits named for the Bidens. Of the $1 million the Bidens donated to charity in 2017, $100,000 went to the Joseph Biden Foundation Community Legal Aid Society Inc., and $150,000 went to the Beau Biden Foundation for the Protection of Children, an organization named for Biden\u2019s son, who died of brain cancer in 2015. An additional $55,000 went to Biden-related charities in 2018. Also in 2018, the Bidens reported a $25,000 contribution to the International Assn. of Firefighters Foundation.

[ 26 ] The federal government has not elected to implement the type of controversial family planning programs that have reduced population growth of other developing nations, a result of low political support for these programs and a cultural preference for large families as well as high levels of social instability.

{"claim": "This Democratic Party of Joe Biden is pushing the so-called Green New Deal. If given power, they would essentially ban animal agriculture and eliminate gas-powered cars.", "label": "Refuted", "result": {"response": "To assess the factual accuracy of the statement regarding the Democratic Party under Joe Biden pushing the Green New Deal and its implications for animal agriculture and gas-powered cars, we can analyze the provided knowledge points.\n\n1. **Green New Deal Context**: The Green New Deal is a proposed package of legislation aimed at addressing climate change and economic inequality. While it has been associated with progressive Democrats, including some members of Congress, it is not a formal policy that Biden has fully endorsed or implemented as part of his administration's agenda.\n\n2. **Biden's Climate Goals**: The knowledge indicates that Biden's climate goals include achieving a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions by 2050. However, it does not explicitly mention a ban on animal agriculture or gas-powered cars. Instead, Biden's campaign has focused on transitioning to clean energy and reducing reliance on fossil fuels, while still allowing for some fossil fuel use during the transition period.\n\n3. **Statements on Agriculture and Cars**: The knowledge does not provide any evidence that Biden or the Democratic Party is actively pursuing a ban on animal agriculture or gas-powered vehicles. The focus appears to be on reducing emissions and transitioning to cleaner energy sources rather than outright bans on specific sectors like agriculture or types of vehicles.\n\n4. **Public Perception and Political Reality**: The knowledge suggests that there is a pragmatic approach among Democrats regarding energy policies, indicating that they are aware of the political realities and the need for a balanced approach to energy and environmental issues.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement that the Democratic Party under Joe Biden is pushing a Green New Deal that would essentially ban animal agriculture and eliminate gas-powered cars is not supported by the provided knowledge. There is no indication that such extreme measures are part of Biden's agenda.\n\nThus, the conclusion is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "have.\u201d To win his 2022 U.S. Senate race, he said that with new regulations in place, \u201cI support fracking.\u201d Democratic voters did not flinch and stood squarely behind him. Just before Fetterman\u2019s flip-flop, a massive spike in gasoline and other fuel prices in the summer of 2022 helped drive Biden\u2019s job approval to its nadir (36.8 percent on July 21 in the Real Clear Politics average). The public anger was a stark reminder that price hikes and supply disruptions are political poison. Yes, it would be wonderful if we could move to 100 percent renewable energy at breakneck speed. But if we tried that without bridge fuels keeping prices reasonable, a backlash would propel conservatives into office who would bury any Green New Deal dreams for good. One Democrat presumably hoping to rekindle the fracking debate is Biden\u2019s new Democratic challenger, self-help author Marianne Williamson. Her latest campaign platform pledges to \u201cban all fracking operations.\u201d Moreover, she would undermine European support for Ukraine by \u201cend[ing] the use of long-term LNG projects for diplomatic support.\u201d (She has expressed support for aiding Ukraine militarily, though not with a \u201c blank check .\u201d) She could find allies among environmental groups who have continued their fight to ban fracking despite recent developments in Ukraine. In October, a coalition led by Sierra Club demanded the Department of Energy establish rules that would make it easier to deny LNG export projects. That coalition didn\u2019t address what that might do to Ukraine. A separate October report from Public Citizen called for \u201cno new liquefied natural gas export terminals [to] be approved by the U.S. government.\u201d The report acknowledged that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has upended global energy markets but argued that the invasion \u201cmade clear that the boom in U.S. production and exports has not removed Americans from the wild swings of energy markets.\u201d Therefore, \u201cin the long run, we must as a planet wean ourselves from our dangerous dependence on fossil fuels that have sowed turmoil and chaos.\u201d That\u2019s true \u2026 in the long run . But the long run doesn\u2019t commence in just a few years, and the threat of militaristic imperialism from the petrol-state of Russia will not disappear in the short run. For the time being, the free nations of the world need America to build sufficient infrastructure to export natural gas, just as the planet needs America to regulate natural gas\nsure it\u2019s eliminated and no more subsidies for either one of those, either \u2014 any fossil fuel.\u201d He has made other statements about ending fossil fuels since then. \u201cI guarantee you, we\u2019re going to end fossil fuel,\u201d Biden told an environmental activist who confronted him at a campaign event in New Hampshire back in September. Five months later, at another New Hampshire rally in February, Biden said to protesters who interrupted his remarks: \u201cWe are going to get rid of fossil fuels.\u201d But Biden\u2019s plan isn\u2019t that simple, as his campaign explained the day after his initial remarks at the July debate. \u201cJoe Biden is committed to achieving a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions by 2050,\u201d his team said in a statement to reporters who asked for clarification on his proposal. \u201cHe supports eliminating subsidies for coal and gas and deploying carbon capture sequestration technology to create economic benefits for multiple industries and significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions.\u201d As we have written before, net-zero emissions would mean the amount of greenhouse gases emitted in the U.S. would be matched by the amount sequestered, or removed, from the atmosphere. Biden\u2019s climate goals are outlined in \u201c Joe\u2019s Plan for a Clean Energy Revolution and Environmental Justice,\u201d which his campaign released in June 2019. The plan says Biden will provide incentives for the development and use of carbon capture technology, and work to hold polluters financially accountable. It also says Biden will help fossil fuel workers, such as coal miners and power plant operators, make the move to clean energy jobs. But, during the transition, the U.S. would continue to rely on fossil fuels for at least some of its energy. Notably, Biden\u2019s campaign has said he would continue to largely allow fracking, formally known as hydraulic fracturing , a drilling technique used to extract oil and natural gas, which are fossil fuels, from rock formations underground. Some critics concluded that Biden would implement a full ban on fracking after comments he made during a one-on-one debate with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in March. \u201cI\u2019m talking about stopping fracking as soon as we possibly can,\u201d said Sanders, stating his support for an all-out ban. \u201cI\u2019m talking about telling the fossil fuel industry that they are going to stop destroying this planet \u2014 no ifs, buts and maybes about it.\u201d \u201cSo am I,\u201d said Biden, before later adding: \u201cNo more \u2013\nPolitiFact | In debate, Joe Biden said no more oil drilling and no new fracking, didn\u2019t say shutdowns English Espa\u00f1ol Get PolitiFact in your inbox.

(AP/Evan Vucci) By Tom Kertscher March 20, 2020 If Your Time is short In a CNN debate, Biden said no more oil drilling. For natural gas, he promised to allow no new fracking. His stated campaign position is to ban \"new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters.\" See the sources for this fact-check In what was likely the first-ever presidential debate that observed social distancing , in light of the coronavirus crisis, did Joe Biden go extreme? \"America you better pay attention to what's being said!\" warned a post on Facebook on March 15, 2020, the same night of the Democratic debate on CNN. \"Joe Biden just announced on CNN he will completely shut down drilling for oil and natural gas on day one of his administration.\" The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In the one-on-one debate, Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders used the term \"day one\" seven times, according to a transcript . Biden, however, did not use it once. Biden was speaking quickly during the debate and his words were not as precise as they have been at other times. But when we reached out to his campaign, a spokesperson clarified Biden\u2019s intent. Here\u2019s exactly what Biden said on oil drilling: \"Number one, no more subsidies for fossil fuel industry. No more drilling on federal lands. No more drilling, including offshore. No ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period, ends, number one.\" Taken literally, the former vice president\u2019s debate comments could be read to mean that he would end oil drilling. Or it could mean that he would not allow any new drilling, which is how the Biden\nMisleading Ad Targets Biden on Fossil Fuels, Fracking - FactCheck.org Facebook Twitter Tumblr Close Skip to main content FactCheck .org \u00ae A Project of The Annenberg Public Policy Center A TV ad from a Republican super PAC uses video of Joe Biden inaccurately explaining his climate plan against him. Biden\u2019s campaign has said he would not completely ban fossil fuels, specifically fracking, as the ad appears to show him saying. The ad, from America First Action , which supports the reelection of President Donald Trump, shows a clip from a July 2019 CNN debate in which Biden said, \u201cwe would make sure it\u2019s eliminated,\u201d when asked if there would be a place for \u201cfossil fuels, including coal and fracking\u201d if Biden becomes president. Biden\u2019s campaign later clarified that he supports ending subsidies for the fossil fuel industry, and transitioning, by 2050, to a clean energy economy with net-zero emissions. That\u2019s what the plan he released in June 2019 also says he would do. Later in the ad, a graphic shown on screen says, \u201cJoe Biden could cost Pennsylvania 600,000 jobs.\u201d But that figure comes from a U.S. Chamber of Commerce study of a nationwide ban on fracking for oil and natural gas, which Biden\u2019s campaign said he actually doesn\u2019t support. America First Action released the ad on June 4, attacking Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, for proposed policies that would have an impact on energy jobs. The pro-Trump group has so far spent more than $230,000, according to Advertising Analytics, to run the 30-second commercial in at least five TV markets across Pennsylvania \u2014 a key electoral swing state . The ad starts with this abbreviated exchange between Biden and CNN\u2019s Dana Bash during a Democratic presidential candidates\u2019 debate the cable news network hosted last summer: Bash, July 31, 2019: \u2026 would there be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking, in a Biden administration? Biden: No, we would \u2014 we would work it out. We would make sure it\u2019s eliminated. Biden\u2019s full response was: \u201cNo, we would \u2014 we would work it out. We would make sure it\u2019s eliminated and no more subsidies for either one of those, either \u2014 any fossil fuel.\u201d He has made other statements about ending fossil fuels since then. \u201cI guarantee you, we\u2019re going to end fossil fuel,\u201d Biden told an environmental activist who confronted him at a campaign event in\nfew years, and the threat of militaristic imperialism from the petrol-state of Russia will not disappear in the short run. For the time being, the free nations of the world need America to build sufficient infrastructure to export natural gas, just as the planet needs America to regulate natural gas and stop methane leaks properly. For now, rank-and-file Democrats appear to have grasped these political realities. They didn\u2019t punish Fetterman for his reversal last November, and they aren\u2019t punishing Biden now for breaking his permitting pledge. Hopefully, that pragmatic attitude will sustain and resist attempts to needlessly re-open the Democratic divide over fracking.

This suggests a positive view of reduced working hours.\n\n2. **Context of the Knowledge**: The knowledge provided does not include any specific context or background regarding Nancy Pelosi's views on employment, work hours, or the implications of employers cutting hours. Therefore, we need to rely on general knowledge about her political stance and public statements.\n\n3. **General Knowledge about Work Hours**: In general, cutting hours can have mixed implications. While it may provide employees with more free time, it can also lead to reduced income and financial instability for those employees. Politicians and public figures often have nuanced views on such topics, and it is important to consider the broader implications of such statements.\n\n4. **Fact-Checking the Quote**: Without specific evidence or a source confirming that Nancy Pelosi made this exact statement, we cannot definitively verify its accuracy.

This is a specific claim about Biden's stance on police funding.\n\n2. **Knowledge Points**: The provided knowledge does not directly address Biden's statements regarding police funding. However, it does mention various claims made by Trump and Biden during debates and public statements, including their positions on immigration and other policies. \n\n3. **Contextual Analysis**: Historically, Biden has faced scrutiny over his stance on police funding, especially during the 2020 election cycle. He has stated that he does not support defunding the police but rather supports reforming police practices. This context suggests that the claim made by Trump may be misleading or taken out of context.\n\n4. **Fact-Checking**: To verify the accuracy of Trump's claim, we would need to look for direct quotes or transcripts from Biden regarding police funding. If Biden did not explicitly say \"Yes, absolutely\" to cutting police funding, then Trump's statement would be false.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the historical context and Biden's known position against defunding the police, it is likely that Trump's claim is inaccurate.

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, the presumptive presidential nominees, shared a debate stage June 27 for the first time since 2020, in a feisty confrontation that \u2014 thanks to debate rules \u2014 managed to avoid the near-constant interruptions that marred their previous meetings. CNN hosted the debate , which had no audience, at its Atlanta studio. CNN anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash moderated. The debate format allowed CNN to mute candidates' microphones when it wasn't their turn to speak. READ MORE: 3 key moments from CNN's Biden-Trump debate Trump attacked Biden's record, blaming inflation and other issues on Biden's \"insane and stupid policies.\" Biden questioned Trump's conduct, noting that Trump is a convicted felon and saying he has the \"morals of an alley cat.\" Biden and Trump clashed on topics including immigration, the economy, abortion and their ages. Trump's outlandish immigration claim Trump says Biden \"allowed millions of people to come in here from prisons, jails and mental institutions.\" Pants on Fire! Immigration officials arrested about 103,700 noncitizens with criminal convictions (whether in the U.S. or abroad) from fiscal years 2021 to 2024, federal data shows. That accounts for people stopped at and between ports of entry. Not everyone was let in. The term \"noncitizens\" includes people who may have had legal immigration status in the U.S. but were not U.S. citizens. The data reflects the people that the federal government knows about, but it's inexhaustive. However, immigration experts said despite the data's limitations, there is no evidence to support Trump's statement. Biden's close to the mark about immigration reductions Biden: \"I've changed (the law) in the way that now you're in a situation where there are 40 percent fewer people coming across the border illegally.\" Mostly True.

President Donald Trump's first line of the night, about COVID-19 deaths, was false and set the tone as he and Democratic rival Joe Biden unleashed a torrent of claims in their last presidential debate . Trump misrepresented the reality of the pandemic in myriad and familiar ways, insisting against obvious reality that the pandemic is drawing to a close. He also boasted about \"clean\" facilities at the border for migrant children, ignoring the filthy conditions under which they were held in 2018. Biden, at times, was selective on the coronavirus and other matters, at one point stating that no one under Obamacare lost private health coverage. Millions did. A look at how some of the statements on the stage in Nashville, Tennessee, compared with the facts: CORONAVIRUS TRUMP: \"We're rounding the turn. We're rounding the corner. It's going away.\" THE FACTS: No, the coronavirus isn't going away. It's coming back. New cases are on the rise toward their summer peak. Deaths have also been increasing. According to data through Oct. 21 from Johns Hopkins University, the seven-day rolling average for daily new cases in the U.S. rose over the past two weeks from over 42,300 on Oct. 7 to nearly 60,000 on Oct. 21. In that time the seven-day rolling average for daily new deaths in the U.S. rose from 695 to 757. ___ TRUMP: \"All he does is talk about shutdowns. But forget about him.

By Paul Specht , PolitiFact reporter As he accepted the Republican nomination for reelection, President Donald Trump claimed that Joe Biden's immigration plan would disadvantage Americans. \"The Biden plan would eliminate America's borders in the middle of a global pandemic,\" Trump said Aug. 27. \"And he is even talking about taking the wall down. How about that?\" Other WRAL Top Stories Is that right? No. Biden does not plan to eliminate American\u2019s borders, and he has not said he would demolish border construction done by the Trump administration. This fact-check will focus on the wall claim. We asked the White House and Trump\u2019s re-election campaign for evidence that backed Trump\u2019s claim. We didn\u2019t hear back. Biden\u2019s stance on border security Biden has not said he would take down barriers built at the border. What he has said is that he wouldn\u2019t build more of them. \"Trump campaigned on \u2018Build that wall.\u2019 Are you willing to tear that wall down?\" NPR\u2019s Lulu Garcia-Navarro asked Biden in an interview aired Aug. 6. \"No. There will not be another foot of wall constructed on my administration, No. 1,\" Biden answered . \"No. 2, \u2026 I'm going to make sure that we have border protection, but it's going to be based on making sure that we use high-tech capacity to deal with it and at the ports of entry. That's where all bad stuff is happening.\" Biden\u2019s immigration plan says that most contraband comes into the United States through legal ports of entry and that nearly half of the people who are illegally in the country overstayed a visa, rather than crossed a border illegally. Trump has misallocated resources by focusing on a border wall, Biden argues.

These criteria are mentioned with detail in the full notification. The link to the official PDF with complete and updated IAS eligibility criteria is attached here. Next, let\u2019s go deeper into the age limit for UPSC and understand how it applies to different categories. UPSC IAS Eligibility Criteria: Age Limit The age limit is a crucial part for the UPSC exam eligibility requirements. According to the UPSC eligibility criteria 2025 as of 01st August 2025, the age limit for candidates belonging t o different categories is as follows: General: The age limit is 21- 32 years for the General applicants.

In case you are a candidate from PwBD category , i.e., deaf-mute, or blind, or orthopedically handicapped person, relaxation up to a maximum of 10 years is granted. Special Case Scenarios The UPSC has shared some special case scenarios for Age Limit Eligibility through its official notification (link provided below): If you belong to any of the categories of ST/SC/OBC and also under the category of ex-servicemen/blind/deaf-mute/orthopedically handicapped etc, you will be eligible for the grant of cumulative age relaxation under both the categories. For age relaxation on the basis of physical disability, you need to meet the physical and medical standards under the category of PwBD by the government. You need a certificate of disability issued by the govt. or a valid appointing authority. The term Ex \u2013 servicemen will apply to the person who are defined so by the Ex \u2013 servicemen (Re \u2013 employment in Civil Services and Posts) Rules, 1979 , as amended from time to time.

By that time, southern Democrats were fully hostile to the Supreme Court because of its desegregation decisions, and conservative Republicans were worried about the Supreme Court over national security issues, and Stewart got a fair grilling. But like other nominees, he didn't provide them any answers. RAZ: When you say he didn't provide them any answers, he answered their questions, but they weren't particularly substantive? Prof. POWE: That's right. He wouldn't give them the information they were looking for. RAZ: Professor Powe, nowadays it seems, you know, if you make it to the confirmation stage, you're pretty much in. Of course, there was one notable exception in the last 30 years, and that was Judge Bork. Can we really learn anything about these nominees during this process? Prof. POWE: I don't think that we do. We certainly learn that they are willing to obfuscate, because now we seem to give points to the nominee for the ability to avoid answering the questions being asked. Take Justice Scalia. When he was questioned by the senators, one senator asked him: Do you consider Marbury versus Madison settled law? And of course, it's been settled law since it came down in 1803, and Justice Scalia refused to answer on the grounds that the question might come before him as a justice. (Soundbite of laughter) A little later, both Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg were asked whether the Korean War was a war, and both of them declined to answer. RAZ: Professor Powe, will you be watching the Sotomayor hearings? Prof. POWE: If it's a 106 in Austin, I certainly will. (Soundbite of laughter) RAZ: Lucas Powe is a professor of law and government at the University of Texas in Austin. His latest book is called \"The Supreme Court and the American Elite, 1789-2008.\" Professor Powe, thanks for helping us out. Prof. POWE: Thank you very much.

Facebook Flipboard Email\nfive names added in November 2017 to President Donald Trump\u2019s list of potential nominees to the Supreme Court. When Justice Anthony Kennedy retired from the Supreme Court in June 2018, Barrett was allegedly among the finalists to fill the vacancy. The job would go to Justice Brett Kavanaugh, but Trump reportedly told his advisers that he was \u201csaving\u201d Barrett in case Ginsburg were to leave the court during his presidency. Barrett\u2019s nomination and confirmation process played out against the backdrop of President Barack Obama\u2019s March 2016 nomination of Merrick Garland, the highly respected chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to fill the vacancy created by Scalia\u2019s 2016 death. Senate Republicans refused to hold a hearing for Garland, then 63 years old and generally regarded as a more centrist nominee. They maintained that it was too close to the upcoming presidential election, and that the next president, rather than Obama, should choose the new nominee. The seat remained open until April 2017, when Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump\u2019s first Supreme Court nominee, was confirmed. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) paved the way for Barrett\u2019s 2020 nomination last year. When asked at a May 2019 luncheon in Kentucky whether he would fill a vacancy if a Supreme Court justice were to leave the court in 2020, McConnell responded that he would. The difference between such an opening and the situation in 2016, McConnell explained, was that the White House and the Senate in 2016 were controlled by different political parties, while Republicans now hold both the Senate and the White House. But although Ginsburg had announced in December 2018 that she had been treated for lung cancer (the third of what would eventually prove to be five cancer diagnoses), the vacancy was at the time purely a hypothetical one. The hypothetical became real after Ginsburg\u2019s death in September, and McConnell pledged to fill the vacancy quickly. The president was reportedly considering Barrett and two other women \u2013 Judge Barbara Lagoa, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, and Judge Allison Jones Rushing, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit \u2013 to fill the opening left by Ginsburg\u2019s death. But it\u2019s not clear that either woman was ever actually seriously in the running, as the president offered Barrett the job on Sept. 21 and nominated her on Sept. 26,\nwas nominated by Republican president Benjamin Harrison on July 19, 1892. Shiras was confirmed as a Supreme Court justice seven days later, by the Republican controlled Senate on July 26, 1892. [ 13 ] Nomination [ edit ] Potential candidates [ edit ] Main article: Donald Trump Supreme Court candidates During his presidential candidacy in 2016, Trump released a list of jurists he would consider to fill a Supreme Court vacancy, including his first nominee, Neil Gorsuch . An updated short list was released in November 2017. Among the high-profile potential nominees from the list were Amy Coney Barrett , Britt Grant , Amul Thapar and David Stras , who were all elevated to the courts of appeals by President Trump. [ 14 ] In September 2020, President Trump released another list of 20 possible appointees were a vacancy to arise, including Republican senators Tom Cotton (Arkansas), Ted Cruz (Texas), and Josh Hawley (Missouri); [ 15 ] of the three senators, Cruz and Hawley later indicated they would decline a nomination. [ 16 ] On September 19, 2020, President Trump told supporters at a rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina , \"I will be putting forth a nominee next week \u2013 it will be a woman\". [ 17 ] [ 18 ] By September 21, Trump said that his list had been narrowed to just five names, with a final nomination to be made on September 24 or 25. [ 19 ] As of September 2020, President Trump's complete list of Supreme Court candidates contained 44 names, of whom 12 were women. September 22 news reports identified Barrett, Barbara Lagoa , Joan Larsen , Allison Jones Rushing , and Kate Comerford Todd as the top contenders, with Barrett the frontrunner. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Rose Garden ceremony [ edit ] Main article: White House COVID-19 outbreak \u00a7 Amy Coney Barrett nomination events, September 26 Amy Coney Barrett speaks in the Rose Garden after being officially nominated by President Trump, September 26, 2020 On September 26, Trump announced his nomination of Amy Coney Barrett in a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden before an audience of top Washington officials, other dignitaries, and family members. [ 22 ] More than 150 people attended; they were told they did not need to wear masks if they had tested negative that day. Chairs for the outdoor ceremony were placed side by side,\nthe advancement of Barrett's nomination so close to Election Day, after the Republican-led Senate in 2016 refused to hold hearings for then-President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, nearly eight months before that year's election. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., labeled the nomination process a \"cynical power grab.\" \"Nearly every Republican in this chamber led by the majority leader four years ago refused to even consider the Supreme Court nomination of a Democratic president on the grounds ... that we should wait until after the presidential election because the American people deserved a voice in the selection of their next justice,\" he said on Sunday. \"My colleagues, there is no escaping this glaring hypocrisy. As I said before, no tit-for-tat convoluted, distorted version of history will wipe away the stain that will exist forever with this Republican majority and with this Republican leader.\" Barrett's nomination cleared a procedural hurdle Sunday afternoon when the Senate voted to end debate on the nomination, days after Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee boycotted a vote to advance Barrett's nomination. The only Republicans who voted against the cloture motion on Sunday were Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. On Saturday, Murkowski previewed her intentions, saying she planned to vote against moving the nomination forward procedurally but would vote to confirm Barrett on Monday. \"While I oppose the process that led us to this point, I do not hold it against her, as an individual who has navigated the gauntlet with grace, skill and humility,\" she said. Collins faces a tough reelection battle and said after Ginsburg's death in September that whoever wins the presidential election should fill the Supreme Court vacancy . The 48-year-old judge's confirmation solidifies the court's conservative majority, potentially shaping the future of abortion rights and health care law for generations. Elections Pence Aides Test Positive As Coronavirus Consumes Final Days Of Campaign During a campaign event in Tallahassee, Fla., on Saturday, Vice President Pence said he wanted to return to Capitol Hill in time for Monday's vote. \"As vice president, I'm president of the Senate,\" Pence said. \"And I'm gonna be in the chair because I wouldn't miss that vote for the world.\" He ultimately did not attend the vote in person. His presence would have been purely symbolic anyway, as it was not expected that Pence would have needed to cast a tie-breaking vote.

Ron Johnson, who investigated Biden's son, Hunter, and his business dealings in Ukraine. The report did not allege that Joe Biden himself got $3.5 million or that Russia President Vladimir Putin had anything to do with such a payment. Nor does the report allege that Hunter Biden pocketed the money himself. The report said the sum went instead to an investment firm he co-founded.

President Donald Trump's first line of the night, about COVID-19 deaths, was false and set the tone as he and Democratic rival Joe Biden unleashed a torrent of claims in their last presidential debate . Trump misrepresented the reality of the pandemic in myriad and familiar ways, insisting against obvious reality that the pandemic is drawing to a close. He also boasted about \"clean\" facilities at the border for migrant children, ignoring the filthy conditions under which they were held in 2018. Biden, at times, was selective on the coronavirus and other matters, at one point stating that no one under Obamacare lost private health coverage. Millions did. A look at how some of the statements on the stage in Nashville, Tennessee, compared with the facts: CORONAVIRUS TRUMP: \"We're rounding the turn. We're rounding the corner. It's going away.\" THE FACTS: No, the coronavirus isn't going away. It's coming back. New cases are on the rise toward their summer peak. Deaths have also been increasing. According to data through Oct. 21 from Johns Hopkins University, the seven-day rolling average for daily new cases in the U.S. rose over the past two weeks from over 42,300 on Oct. 7 to nearly 60,000 on Oct. 21. In that time the seven-day rolling average for daily new deaths in the U.S. rose from 695 to 757. ___ TRUMP: \"All he does is talk about shutdowns. But forget about him. His Democrat governors Cuomo in New York, you look at what's going on in California, you look at Pennsylvania, North Carolina. Democrats \u2014 Democrats all. They're shut down so tight, and they're dying.\" BIDEN: \"Look at the states that are having such a spike in the coronavirus. They're\nare changed, according to a new Center for Public Integrity/Ipsos poll conducted in early December. The poll also indicates that more than seven in 10 Americans want the federal government to impose moderate or strict contribution limits on super PACs \u2014 technically independent political committees that may raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to advocate for or against candidates. They are not supposed to \u201ccoordinate\u201d their spending with candidates\u2019 campaigns. Following the 2016 presidential election, Americans have deep concerns about how money affects political campaigns, a new Center for Public Integrity/Ipsos poll indicates: Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: If there were no limits on how much money a candidate could receive, there would be no reason to give to super PACs. All Americans Democrat Republican Independent Strongly agree 21% 22% 23% 19% Somewhat agree 43% 43% 47% 38% Somewhat disagree 26% 23% 26% 34% Strongly disagree 9% 12% 5% 8% Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Political donations have little impact on the positions of political candidates. All Americans Democrat Republican Independent Strongly agree 10% 13% 8% 7% Somewhat agree 18% 18% 18% 14% Somewhat disagree 35% 32% 40% 37% Strongly disagree 36% 36% 33% 42% Which of the following is closer to your opinion? All Americans Democrat Republican Independent There should be no limits on candidate or political party fundraising but limitson independent organizations 40% 42% 42% 36% There should be limits on candidate and party fundraising but no limits on independent organizations. 60% 58% 58% 64% Method: These findings come from a Center for Public Integrity/Ipsos poll conducted Dec. 5-6, 2016. For the survey, a sample of roughly 1,008 adults age 18+ from the continental U.S., Alaska and Hawaii was interviewed online in English. Full methodology Together, super PACs, politically active nonprofits and similar groups spent more than $743 million to influence the 2016 presidential election alone, the Center for Responsive Politics calculated . They include super PACs with close ties to Trump, Democrat Hillary Clinton and other also-ran presidential candidates such as Republicans Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, John Kasich and Marco Rubio. The FEC\u2019s newly minted chairman, longtime commissioner Steven Walther, will attempt to orchestrate his agency\u2019s discord into something modestly more symphonic, at least on a couple of imminent matters: overseeing the agency\u2019s move to a new headquarters and completing an overhaul of its outmoded website . He\nThe wall would cost $8-$12 billion, and Mexico would pay for it. Status: $15 billion, and U.S. taxpayers paid for it. Perhaps Trump\u2019s most consistent promise about the border wall was that Mexico would pay for it. \"I will have Mexico pay for that wall, mark my words,\" Trump said at his presidential announcement speech, one of hundreds of times he made that promise. He said during his 2016 campaign that it would cost $8 billion , or perhaps $12 billion, for his 1,000-mile wall. In fact, the federal government has allocated $15 billion for the 453 mile project, according to Time Magazine . Mexico did not pay for the wall; its leaders have refused since Trump first made his promise. After Trump's inauguration, the president began suggesting that the U.S. would initially pay, but that Mexico would reimburse the U.S. for the wall . That has also not happened. Taxpayers foot the bill for Trump's wall. Promise: The wall will be 'big, beautiful' and 'concrete' Status: Not exactly. Trump spent a lot of time as a candidate talking about how his \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d border wall would look. He often said it would be made out of concrete; he said it would be 35 or 40 or 55 or 80 feet tall, depending on the rally. \u201cThe politicians would come up to me, and they\u2019d say, \u2018You know, Donald, you can\u2019t build the wall.\u2019 I said, \u2018You have to be kidding. You have to be kidding. Concrete plank, you have to be kidding. Precast, precast, right? Boom. Bing. Done. Keep going,\u201d he said in August 2016. As president, he spent millions on border wall prototypes \u2014 some concrete, some steel \u2014 to test new border wall structures; all eight were vulnerable to breaching and have since been torn down. The Trump administration has continued to use steel bollard fencing designs for border barriers, just like the Obama administration. Jane C. Timm Jane C.

{"claim": "Today, we grapple with multiple challenges with a population exceeding 200 million.", "label": "Supported", "result": {"response": "To assess the factual accuracy of the statement \"Today, we grapple with multiple challenges with a population exceeding 200 million,\" we can analyze the provided knowledge points.\n\n1. **Population Data**: The knowledge indicates that Nigeria's population is projected to be over 206 million, with specific figures such as 206,283,338 mentioned. This confirms that Nigeria's population indeed exceeds 200 million.\n\n2. **Challenges**: While the knowledge does not explicitly list the challenges faced by Nigeria, it is widely recognized that a population exceeding 200 million can lead to various challenges, including but not limited to economic issues, healthcare, education, infrastructure, and resource management.\n\n3. **Contextual Understanding**: The statement implies that the challenges are a direct consequence of the large population. Given the context of Nigeria's demographic data and the common issues faced by countries with large populations, it is reasonable to conclude that Nigeria does grapple with multiple challenges related to its population size.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the statement is factually accurate.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"True\"\n}\n```", "answer": "True"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "The 2023 Census will be Nigeria's first Digital Census and will change how the Census is being conducted in Nigeria before now.\n] Age Population Percent Total 140,431,790 100 0\u20134 22,594,967 16.09 5\u20139 20,005,380 14.25 10\u201314 16,135,950 11.49 15\u201319 14,899,419 10.61 20\u201324 13,435,079 9.57 25\u201329 12,211,426 8.70 30\u201334 9,467,538 6.74 35\u201339 7,331,755 5.22 40\u201344 6,456,470 4.60 45\u201349 4,591,293 3.27 50\u201354 4,249,219 3.03 55\u201359 2,066,247 1.47 60\u201364 2,450,286 1.74 65\u201369 1,151,048 0.82 70\u201374 1,264,937 0.95 75\u201379 579,838 0.41 80\u201384 760,053 0.54 85+ 715,225 0.51 Age group Total Male Female % 0\u201314 58,736,297 30,462,148 28,274,149 41.83 15\u201364 77,158,732 38,348,799 38,809,933 54.94 65+ 4,536,761 2,534,541 2,002,220 3.23 Population by age group (estimates 1.VII.2016) (Data are projections based on the 2006 Population Census.)

The latest efforts to reclassify such offenses as serious felonies have faced resistance but have also seen renewed support due to public backlash.\n\n2. **Current Legal Framework**: Under current California law, human trafficking of a minor for commercial sex incurs significant penalties, including a sentence of up to 12 years in prison, and potentially 15 years to life if certain aggravating factors are present. This indicates that the state takes offenses related to child trafficking seriously.\n\n3. **Legislative Efforts**: The knowledge points out that there have been multiple attempts to strengthen laws against child trafficking, and the recent pushback from the public has led to renewed efforts to pass stricter legislation. This suggests that there is an ongoing commitment to combat child trafficking rather than legalizing it.\n\n4. **Opposition to Tougher Sentences**: Some lawmakers have opposed tougher penalties due to concerns about over-incarceration and the potential for harsh sentences to affect individuals who may themselves be victims of trafficking. However, this does not equate to legalizing pedophilia.\n\nBased on these points, the statement that \"PEDOPHILIA is now LEGAL in CALIFORNIA\" is inaccurate.

Photo by Rahul Lal for CalMatters In summary California lawmakers tried nine times to stiffen penalties for trafficking of a minor. The latest effort appeared to die \u2014 until a social media campaign forced Democrats to reconsider. It was a perfunctory committee hearing on a day full of them in the Legislature. The measure in question on Tuesday wasn\u2019t novel, just another in a long list of attempts to reclassify a misdemeanor as a felony. Like most attempts before it, it met a quiet and undignified end. The bill was new, but what it sought to do was not. Lawmakers from both parties had made numerous previous attempts to reclassify human trafficking of a minor for purposes of a commercial sex act as a \u201cserious felony,\u201d which would be treated as a strike under California\u2019s Three Strikes law. In 2007, twice in 2009, 2011, 2013, 2017 and three times in 2021, legislators tried and failed to reclassify child sex trafficking. But then something strange happened after the latest effort went down. A backlash swiftly took shape on social media. Comments ranged from \u201cWhat on earth were these Democrats thinking?\u201d to accusations that they were siding with pedophiles \u2014 and at least one Democratic member of the Assembly Public Safety Committee that quashed the bill reported receiving death threats. Soon the bill, which had already passed the Senate unanimously, began collecting new, high-profile allies. Gov. Gavin Newsom at a press conference expressed dismay at its failure, telling reporters that he\u2019d reach out to the bill\u2019s Republican author, Sen. Shannon Grove of Bakersfield. Newly seated Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas , a Salinas Democrat, also said he was \u201cvery much engaged\u201d in trying to move the bill forward. So on Thursday the Assembly Public Safety Committee took it up again. And on the second go-around, it passed. Human trafficking of a minor for purposes of commercial sex under current law incurs a sentence of up to 12 years in prison. If the crime involved force, fear, fraud, deceit, coercion, violence, duress, menace, or threat of unlawful injury to the victim or to another person, the sentence is 15 years to life. If the person is\nPublic Safety Committee did the right thing and passed (the bill) that will make sure repeat offenders of child sex trafficking are held accountable,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones, a San Diego Republican. \u201cIf it were not for the extraordinary pushback from figures around the state and nation, I fear the Democrats\u2019 one-party rule and some of their radical ideologies would have prevailed.\u201d The bill\u2019s author, Grove, said in a statement that she expects the cooperation of Assembly Democrats should the bill reach the floor \u2013 its next stop is the Assembly Appropriations Committee. \u201cProtecting victims of child sex trafficking should not be a partisan issue,\u201d Grove said. \u201cToday is a victory for every survivor.\u201d CalMatters newsletter writer Lynn La contributed to this report.

If the crime involved force, fear, fraud, deceit, coercion, violence, duress, menace, or threat of unlawful injury to the victim or to another person, the sentence is 15 years to life. If the person is convicted of inflicting great bodily harm on the victim while trafficking them, a judge can add up to 10 years to a prison sentence. If the child trafficking bill passes the full Assembly and Newsom signs it, people convicted of the crime would face longer prison terms and potential life sentences. The 48 hours between Tuesday\u2019s original vote and Thursday\u2019s session was yet another collision of California\u2019s goals of reducing incarceration by moving away from tough-on-crime laws, and the political reality of negative advertising. More than a decade ago, then-Assemblymember Richard Pan tried to add five new offenses related to human trafficking and the abuse of a child to the serious felony list. The 2011 measure never made it out of committee. Pan, a Democrat who was in both the Assembly and Senate, said he was not sure what was different this time. \u201cSometimes you never know what gets the attention of the public,\u201d Pan said. \u201cThere are these tensions (between reducing the prison population and harsher sentences). \u201cBut we don\u2019t start off by saying abusing children is not a serious crime.\u201d Some progressive lawmakers have opposed toughening penalties for sex trafficking because they were persuaded that it would contribute to the over-incarceration of Black people, and needlessly extend already-significant prison sentences \u2014costing taxpayers more money while demonstrating little public benefit. Opponents also have contended that harsher sentences may end up being applied to people at the lowest rungs of trafficking, who may be trafficked themselves. \u201cThere is no evidence that long prison sentences deter or prevent crime,\u201d the advocacy group Sister Warriors Freedom Coalition wrote in opposition to the bill. \u201cIf anything, low-level individuals involved in human trafficking will be prosecuted under this legislation, many of them will be prosecuted for conduct done under duress or other pressures, and they will be easily and swiftly replaced.\u201d But nuance like that can be difficult, if not impossible, to persuasively convey in a political campaign \u2014 and this was an issue conservatives knew they could weaponize against Democrats.

The fallout was quick and fierce after Democratic members of the Assembly Public Safety Committee abstained from voting on the bill Tuesday, effectively blocking it. \u201cYou can choose a team, pick pedophiles or children,\u201d Assemblymember Heath Flora, a Ripon Republican, said Thursday morning. Insults, threats to California Democrats \u201cI think certainly the thousands of social media texts we got, and me personally, the two death threats I got and the death threats made against my children certainly raised a level of concern in terms of making sure we had some resolution to this bill at this moment right now,\u201d Assemblymember Mia Bonta, an Oakland Democrat, told CalMatters. The volume from Twitter, Republicans and some Democrats led at least one committee member to change her mind. \u201cOn Tuesday, I made a bad decision,\u201d Assemblymember Liz Ortega , a Hayward Democrat, wrote Thursday on Twitter. \u201cVoting against legislation targeting really bad people who traffic children was wrong. I regret doing that and I am going to help get this important legislation passed into law.\u201d Ultimately Bonta and Assemblymember Isaac Bryant both abstained from voting on the bill in the Assembly Public Safety Committee hearing on Thursday. Assemblymember Reggie Jones-Sawyer, a Los Angeles Democrat and chair of the committee, said the vote on Thursday was so markedly different from Tuesday\u2019s vote because questions he had about the bill were answered in the interim. Republicans on child trafficking bill Noting the death threats against Bonta, Jones-Sawyer said in a hallway interview that the \u201cTrumpian hate \u2026 is just wrong.\u201d \u201cYou can have an honest debate, but, my god, you should not threaten a woman because of her personal feelings on an issue,\u201d he said. After the bill cleared the Assembly Public Safety Committee, Republican legislators celebrated the victory in a state where they rarely get to do so. \u201cIn the end, my Democrat colleagues in the Assembly Public Safety Committee did the right thing and passed (the bill) that will make sure repeat offenders of child sex trafficking are held accountable,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones, a San Diego Republican. \u201cIf it were not for the extraordinary pushback from figures around the state and nation, I"}], "source": "rag_only"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 5, "concluded_by_rag": true, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.2}

The postcard was delivered to households throughout the country beginning March 21 , sparking criticism for their prominent display of President Trump\u2019s name during an election year. During the early weeks of the pandemic in the United States, the Trump administration\u2019s inconsistent messaging and inadequate handling of the looming public health crisis led to mistrust and confusion, including regarding mask-wearing. It was not until April 2020 that health officials recommended that all individuals wear face masks to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Public records previously obtained by American Oversight indicate that government officials knew about the importance of mask wearing by late March. A March 31 email exchange between Deputy National Security Adviser Matthew Pottinger, who served on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, and Robert Kadlec, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at HHS, praised a public service announcement from the Czech Republic about the importance of masks. Over the following months, however, Trump downplayed the effectiveness of face coverings and quickly politicized mask-wearing, even as officials close to the president internally acknowledged their effectiveness.

Introduction Facemasks covering the entrances to the airways were widely mandated during the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, not only for healthcare workers but also for the general population ( 1 ). Professions with frequent human contact were obligated to wear them for long periods as were schoolchildren ( 1 \u2013 6 ). This raises reasonable concerns: first, because use by the general population is associated with a higher risk of improper handling of the mask ( 7 \u2013 11 ); secondly because their efficacy against respiratory viral infections is unproven by high quality trials, which indicate little or no effect ( 12 , 13 ) and thirdly, because masks are assumed only to have positive effects ( 14 \u2013 16 ). In reality there is strong evidence that masks pose various risks, especially for pregnant women, children and adolescents, as well as older adults and the unwell ( 14 , 16 \u2013 19 ). They have several demonstrably adverse effects, affecting physiology ( 14 , 16 , 19 \u2013 23 ), psychology ( 16 , 24 ) and, most obviously, social interactions ( 25 \u2013 35 ). Effects on childhood development are a particular concern. These adverse effects have been recently summarised as the so-called mask-induced exhaustion syndrome MIES ( 14 , 16 , 19 ). Interestingly, Spira ( 36 ) and F\u00f6gen ( 37 ) found significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality rates in the mask-wearing cohorts: explanations are uncertain, but viral trapping and recycling are plausible. A further concern, encompassed within MIES, relates to the potential adverse microbiological consequences of wearing face masks. Owing to the creation of a warm, moist micro-environment ( 38 \u2013 41 ), bacteria, fungi and even viruses may accumulate on both sides of the worn masks ( 42 \u2013 46 ). So far, these aspects have not been evaluated in depth. The aim of our pilot study was to assess, visualise and categorise the general ability of masks to accumulate bacteria when used by the general population. This also with regard to a risk assessment, using worst-case consideration which is necessary in such a protective approach ( 47 ). Accordingly, we undertook a microbiological exploration with random samples of face masks as used by members of the general population, together with a systematic rapid literature review.

This new virus was first identified in the city of Wuhan in the Hubei province 1 . Since then, it has spread to over 203 countries, and was officially declared as a global pandemic illness by the World Health Organization (WHO) 2 . After almost 2 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has left a toll of 446 million infected and more than 6.0 million deaths worldwide 3 . From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of facemasks (FMs) has been controversial due to political, cultural and economic causes. However, multiple studies have highlighted the efficiency of FM in the reduction of COVID-19 transmission (i.e., from 6 to 80%) 4 . In another report the use of medical/surgical masks reduced the transmission rates by 85% 5 . Countries worldwide have adapted many different approaches to control the disease 6 . Non-pharmaceutical actions included the use gowns, gloves, and FM, all of which have been proven to be effective and more recently, the use of vaccines such as the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine, Curevac, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Sino pharm has proven effective in the control of the pandemic 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 . Some side effects associated with the use of FMs have been reported. The most common side effect described by healthcare workers was bilateral headaches (affecting up to 80% of users), dermatitis, itchy rash and elevated heart rates 11 . However, the WHO has advised populations to wear FMs on a large scale only excluding patients with limited respiratory conditions 4 . Recently updated guidelines issued by the WHO advised the use of FMs as part of its prevention recommendations which also included hand hygiene, physical distance of at least 1 m, avoidance of face touching and adequate indoor ventilation 2 , 12 . Previous clinical studies have addressed the potential impact of FMs on brain and cognitive functions 13 , 14 . One study in healthy young people showed that the 150-min use of surgical mask had no significant mental fatigue perception 13 while another showed that the prolonged use of FMs can result in headache and impaired\nof object, anywhere,\u201d Dr. Adalja says. Should you shave your facial hair to reduce coronavirus risk? Despite what people are saying online, no, this is not the case. People \u201cshouldn\u2019t start shaving to try to avoid contracting coronavirus,\u201d Dr. Adalja says. Again, the CDC graphic was to warn workers about how facial hair could interfere with the ability to safely use a face mask. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a graphic to tell you that. If you have a beard that touches the floor, a face mask isn\u2019t going to fit properly on your face,\u201d Dr. Adalja says. Even so, health officials aren\u2019t currently recommending that people wear face masks to avoid contracting coronavirus . \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you have a beard or not. There\u2019s no reason for the general public to be wearing a mask,\u201d Dr. Adalja says. Experts stress that these masks are often not used correctly by the general public, offer a false sense of security, and are not designed to be worn for long periods of time. (The exception: The CDC says that people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 should wear a mask when they\u2019re in the same room as other people.)

Subsequently, the use of face masks was strongly recommended 1 , 2 and has been established to prevent infection, leading to the routine use of disposable nonwoven face masks 3 , 4 . Although face masks reduce the risk of viral infection 5 , they can be a source of bacterial contamination, increasing the risk of transfer to food and other products. Staphylococci, primarily Staphylococcus epidermidis ( S. epidermidis ) and Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ), are present on human facial skin 6 . S. aureus is the most virulent Staphylococcus species, causing pyogenic skin diseases, inflammatory diseases (e.g., pneumonia and meningitis), and toxic shock syndrome in humans 7 , 8 . S. aureus also produces heat-resistant staphylococcal enterotoxins when growing in food, causing food poisoning 9 , 10 , 11 . These indigenous skin bacteria adhere to face masks and were reported to alter the diversity of the nasal and buccal microbiota 12 . Face masks can be kept hygienic using ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, autoclaving, and treatment with ethylene oxide or hydrogen peroxide 13 . However, these methods are difficult to implement in households. Although face mask condition affects bacterial viability, there are few data-based reports on the hygienic use of face masks in households. In addition, the mass use of disposable face masks has raised new concerns about hygiene and safety as well as the environment 14 . It has been reported that if every British citizen used one disposable face mask every day for one year, a total of 124,000 tons of waste would be generated, of which 66,000 tons would be contaminated plastic waste that cannot be recycled 15 . Keeping face masks hygienic in a manner that can be implemented at home reduces the amount that is disposed of and reduces the impact on the environment.

But he says his early comments have been taken out of context, claiming he was initially cautious because there was a shortage of PPE for healthcare professionals. In early March, Dr Fauci said: \"It could lead to a shortage of masks for the people who really need it.\" By the end of March, Fauci said recommending face coverings outside a healthcare setting was under \"serious consideration\". Since April, Dr Fauci as well as the CDC have recommended the use of face coverings in certain settings to help slow the spread of coronavirus. Biden: \"We have 4% of the world's population, [but] 20% of the deaths\". Verdict: This is roughly correct. The US population is around 328 million, which is just over 4% of the 7.7 billion global population. There have been over 225,000 coronavirus deaths recorded in the US, according to the latest John Hopkins University data. The total number of deaths recorded worldwide is around 1,161,000.

This combined holistic approach\nsurgical masks an \u201cacceptable alternative.\u201d A follow-up email from the staff secretary detailed feedback from staff, including a comment about whether the mask guidance would be confusing given the White House\u2019s messaging regarding masks. \u201cAre we being consistent with the \u2018wear mask\u2019 message?\u201d the comment reads. \u201cWe (and [White House Coronavirus Task Force] members) have been saying only medical professionals should wear masks, so just want to be sure we\u2019re being consistent.\u201d The final version of the postcard did not include the guidance on mask-wearing. The postcard was delivered to households throughout the country beginning March 21 , sparking criticism for their prominent display of President Trump\u2019s name during an election year. During the early weeks of the pandemic in the United States, the Trump administration\u2019s inconsistent messaging and inadequate handling of the looming public health crisis led to mistrust and confusion, including regarding mask-wearing. It was not until April 2020 that health officials recommended that all individuals wear face masks to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Public records previously obtained by American Oversight indicate that government officials knew about the importance of mask wearing by late March. A March 31 email exchange between Deputy National Security Adviser Matthew Pottinger, who served on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, and Robert Kadlec, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at HHS, praised a public service announcement from the Czech Republic about the importance of masks. Over the following months, however, Trump downplayed the effectiveness of face coverings and quickly politicized mask-wearing, even as officials close to the president internally acknowledged their effectiveness. In a May 2020 email to colleagues, White House Senior Adviser Jared Kushner shared information from \u201ca good source\u201d who said, \u201cMasks really work, and are the silver bullet in Asia,\u201d and cited statistics from Taiwan showing the transmission reduction resulting from wearing masks. Other records obtained by American Oversight last year revealed that the U.S. Postal Service had a plan to mail masks to every U.S. household in April 2020; the Washington Post reported that the plan was scrapped by the White House. Opposition to mask-wearing in the early months of the pandemic worsened the impacts of Covid-19 across the country. Multiple studies have shown that masks are effective in helping prevent the spread of the coronavirus, and one paper published early this year found that if masks had been nationally mandated for employees early in the\naffecting bacterial viability on face masks, providing data that can be applied for the effective household disinfection of face masks.

Subsequently, the use of face masks was strongly recommended 1 , 2 and has been established to prevent infection, leading to the routine use of disposable nonwoven face masks 3 , 4 . Although face masks reduce the risk of viral infection 5 , they can be a source of bacterial contamination, increasing the risk of transfer to food and other products. Staphylococci, primarily Staphylococcus epidermidis ( S. epidermidis ) and Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ), are present on human facial skin 6 . S. aureus is the most virulent Staphylococcus species, causing pyogenic skin diseases, inflammatory diseases (e.g., pneumonia and meningitis), and toxic shock syndrome in humans 7 , 8 . S. aureus also produces heat-resistant staphylococcal enterotoxins when growing in food, causing food poisoning 9 , 10 , 11 . These indigenous skin bacteria adhere to face masks and were reported to alter the diversity of the nasal and buccal microbiota 12 . Face masks can be kept hygienic using ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, autoclaving, and treatment with ethylene oxide or hydrogen peroxide 13 . However, these methods are difficult to implement in households. Although face mask condition affects bacterial viability, there are few data-based reports on the hygienic use of face masks in households. In addition, the mass use of disposable face masks has raised new concerns about hygiene and safety as well as the environment 14 . It has been reported that if every British citizen used one disposable face mask every day for one year, a total of 124,000 tons of waste would be generated, of which 66,000 tons would be contaminated plastic waste that cannot be recycled 15 . Keeping face masks hygienic in a manner that can be implemented at home reduces the amount that is disposed of and reduces the impact on the environment. However, there is still insufficient data to determine\nus are at high risk or could become high risk at certain times: high risk categories include people of old age, patients with open wounds or damaged/inflamed skin or mucosal membranes, weak immune system or many other chronic and acute medical conditions, drug users, people using many kinds of medications including steroids and immunosuppressants, and pregnant or recently pregnant individuals. Additionally, if one is traveling, it may be wise to use PPE to reduce the spread of novel diseases from one location to another (CDC, 2020). Thus, PPE use can prevent many infections and save many lives. 2. Do masks become contaminated with bacteria? Leading up to our research question, it may first be necessary to investigate why the contamination of PPE (specifically masks) may be emerging as an important topic of research. During the height of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, masks were a key PPE that the general public and healthcare workers wore. Masks trap bacteria and viruses and were made obligatory since they were the best possible way to prevent the spread of the virus in public areas. Throughout the use of masks in the pandemic, it was found that face masks were often touched with the hands and encountered many different surfaces throughout the time they were put on and taken off. This exposure to different surfaces makes it exponentially easier for microorganisms to attach to the mask and \u201chitchhike\u201d from place to place with the carrier (Nightingale et al., 2023). Before the pandemic, masks were only worn for specific cases and short periods of time, and thus accumulation of bacteria on the mask was not considered an issue. In the few cases where masks were worn for a longer time (e.g.: surgeons and their teams), they were typically not touched by the wearer, and it was assumed that their outside surface would not become meaningfully contaminated. However, during the pandemic masks are worn for extended periods of time in healthcare facilities (hours and hours), and this prolonged time worn increases the risk of contamination. 3. If they do become contaminated, should we worry about it? Despite these concerns, there is presently very little research data availability, and thus little awareness among health facilities personnel, about the potential for masks to become contaminated. For this reason, our research group decided to initiate a study on this critical topic (Nightingale et al., 2023). We tested for bacterial contamination"}], "source": "rag_only"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 5, "concluded_by_rag": true, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.2}

[ 13 ] Description [ edit ] The 1,954-mile (3,145-kilometer) border between Mexico and the U.S. traverses a variety of terrain, including urban areas and deserts. [ 14 ] The border from the Gulf of Mexico to El Paso, Texas , follows the Rio Grande , a natural barrier. The barrier is on both urban and uninhabited sections of the border, where the most illegal crossings and drug trafficking have been observed in the past. These urban areas include San Diego , California, and El Paso, Texas. [ 15 ] The fencing includes a steel fence (varying in height between 18 and 27 feet (4.8 and 8.1 meters)) that divides the border towns of Nogales, Arizona , in the U.S. and Nogales, Sonora , in Mexico. [ 16 ] 97% of border apprehensions (foreign nationals caught in the U.S. illegally) by the Border Patrol in 2010 occurred at the southwest border. The number declined 61% from 1,189,000 in 2005 to 723,842 in 2008 to 463,000 in 2010. The decrease in apprehensions is the result of numerous factors, including changes in U.S. economic conditions and border enforcement efforts. Border apprehensions in 2010 were at their lowest level since 1972. [ 15 ] [ 17 ] Total apprehensions for 2017, 2018, and 2019 were 415,517, 521,090, and 977,509, respectively. [ 18 ] And while the barrier is along the border with Mexico, 80% of those apprehended are not Mexican. [ 19 ] As a result of the barrier, the number of people trying to cross in areas that have no fence, such as the Sonoran Desert and the Baboquivari Mountains in Arizona, has increased. [ 20 ] Such immigrants must cross 50 miles (80 km) of inhospitable terrain to reach the first road, which is in the Tohono O\u02bcodham Indian Reservation .

Drugs \u2014 drugs alone \u2014 what this wall does is it helps us shape the behavior of the cartels. It puts us in an offensive position, just like the President said. Because of that, this year \u2014 year, to date \u2014 we\u2019ve seized over a million pounds of drugs. Think about that: this year, to date, a million pounds of drugs. And this wall is helping shape the behavior so that we can get better at doing that. We talked about criminals. We apprehend thousands of criminals every single year. Think about that. You know, a lot of these individuals are violent criminals. Because of this wall, we\u2019re able to apprehend and stop these criminals from coming into this country to repeat their offenses. So we have fewer victims of United States citizens because of the wall, because of what this President has provided us. Let\u2019s talk about gangs. Every single year, we stop hundreds and hundreds of gangs from pouring into this country \u2014 like MS-13, whose motto is \u201cRape, Kill, and Control.\u201d That\u2019s their motto: \u201cRape, Kill, and Control.\u201d Just recently \u2014 it wasn\u2019t that long ago \u2014 they used machetes to hack up their victims, and they actually leave them decapitated. That\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about when we\u2019re talking about what this tool provides us. And then, of course, illegal immigration: Even during the height of a global pandemic, illegal immigration continues. And they allow themselves to be put in stash houses that are unsanitary, unsafe. They\u2019re put in tractor trailers for days. I mean, there\u2019s COVID \u2014 that\u2019s like a COVID petri dish. But yet, they\u2019re coming across.\nthere have been more military operations at the border. The administration has also increased the number of expedited removals. Biden has tried to work with Congress to overhaul the immigration system, but a majority of Republican lawmakers have not moved forward with the Senate $118 billion border agreement . Claim 2: Biden\u2019s executive order has reduced illegal migration Unable to act more broadly without Congress, Biden has implemented a handful of policies aimed at reducing the number of crossings, and asylum claims, at the Southern border over the last few months. One June 4, Biden issued executive actions severely restricted asylum claims between ports of entry , blocking most unauthorized migrants from attaining asylum. The Biden administration has said that since the policy went into effect, there has been a 40% decrease in unauthorized crossings. But these types of dips are not surprising. Historically, these policies deter migrants for a short period of time, but those numbers tend to go up, according to an analysis by the D.C.-based Washington Office on Latin America. Migrants tend to go into a wait-and-see period before crossing again. Many migrants who have talked to NPR in Mexican border communities have said they will attempt to cross, despite the policies . Of note: Biden\u2019s asylum restrictions mirror those implemented by Trump, but that Biden lifted in 2021 . Claim 3: Migrants crossing are committing crimes There is no doubt that some migrants who have crossed the border without authorization have committed crimes. This has been something Republicans have been hammering on recently, after two Venezuelan immigrants were charged with capital murder for killing a 12-year-old girl. But data shows a vast majority of immigrants do not commit crimes. In fact, a study by Northwestern University examining a 150-year period found that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than people born in the U.S. Facebook Flipboard Email\nnow you're in a situation where there are 40 percent fewer people coming across the border illegally.\" Mostly True. The Department of Homeland Security announced that illegal immigration encounters dropped by 40 percent, to fewer than 2,400 each day , in the weeks after Biden announced a policy largely barring asylum access for people entering the U.S. at the southern border. The policy was announced June 4. But immigration experts caution that it's difficult to pinpoint a single reason for any change in border crossings. For example, other factors, such as hot weather , can affect migration patterns. Since the policy was announced only a few weeks ago, it's unclear whether the drop in illegal immigration will continue . Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, associate policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, told PolitiFact the policy could have a short-term deterrent effect. But Adam Isacson, defense oversight director at the Washington Office on Latin America told PolitiFact, that no crackdown in the past decade has had a lasting impact . Trump's falsehoods about his and Biden's economic achievements Trump: \"I gave you the largest tax cut in history.\" False. When it was passed in 2017, Trump's tax cut was, in inflation-adjusted dollars, the fourth-largest since 1940. And as a percentage of gross domestic product, it ranked seventh in history, according to figures published by the Treasury Department. Trump: \"The only jobs (Biden) created are for illegal immigrants and bounceback jobs, bounce back from the COVID.\" False. Since Biden took office in early 2021, the number of foreign-born Americans who are employed has risen by about 5.6 million. But over the same time period, the number of native-born Americans employed has increased by almost 7.4 million. (There are many more native-born Americans than foreign-born Americans, so on a percentage basis, the increase for foreign-born Americans is about 22 percent, compared with 6 percent for native-born Americans.) It's also wrong to say that all the foreign-born employment gains (much less all the employment gains, period) stem from migrants here illegally. The data for foreign-born Americans includes anyone born outside the U.S., including immigrants who have been in the United States legally for decades. Employment on Biden's watch passed its prepandemic level by June 2022, about a year-and-a-half into his term. Since then, the U.S. economy has created an additional 6.2 million jobs. Biden's economic talking points mostly hit the mark Biden: \"Black unemployment is the\nThat\u2019s fantastic. That\u2019s fantastic.

Salman Ghazi, managing director of Iqra Education Foundation, which provides religious curriculum to nearly 200 regular schools run by Muslim managements, said that the low participation of Muslims in higher education has its roots in the partition of the country. \"There was discrimination against Muslims in the aftermath. The tendency among young men was that higher education was a waste of time and money because they faced odds while aspiring for government jobs,\" said Ghazi. However, a Maharashtra cadre officer from the 1979 IAS batch said that low participation of Muslims in the exams, rather than discrimination, was the cause for their low representation in the services. \"As a Muslim, I never faced discrimination. Muslims were around 3.5% of the successful candidates at that time. I do not know whether it is true today, but the percentage of Muslim candidates was lower. However, the success rate for Muslims was higher. If there was discrimination, this would not be the case,\" said the former bureaucrat. There is also a consensus that the community was turning to higher education in larger numbers. \"Globalisation has reduced religious discrimination, and there are many Muslims in the corporate world in India.

After the result was declared, many students came forward saying that there are discrepancies in the evaluation process. One student also filed a petition in the Bombay High Court after receiving zero marks in the NEET 2020 exams, even though while checking her OMR sheet, she had calculated herself getting at least 600 out of 720 marks. Another student has pointed out that as per the scanned OMR sheet uploaded by NTA, he has scored a perfect 720 out of 720, but according to the final scorecard, he scored a mere 212 in the NEET 2020 exams, which is highly unlikely. This year, the NEET 2020 exam result was released on October 16 and two students ended up scoring full marks i.e. 720 out of 720 in the medical entrance examination. The NEET 2020 counselling process will start soon.

He was not involved in the founding of the World Bank or the IMF, as these institutions were created long before his presidency.\n\n3. **Dr. Jose Rizal**: \n   - Dr. Jose Rizal was a Filipino nationalist and revolutionary who lived from 1861 to 1896. He was a key figure in the Philippine reform movement against Spanish colonial rule. Rizal died in 1896, well before the establishment of the World Bank and IMF.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n   - Both Ferdinand Marcos and Dr. Jose Rizal had no role in the founding of the World Bank and the IMF. The statement incorrectly attributes the establishment of these institutions to them.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the statement is factually inaccurate.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 0, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.2}

It is not owned by George Soros. Instead, it operates independently and is known for its use of technology and data analysis in investment strategies.\n\n2. **George Soros**: George Soros is a well-known investor and philanthropist, famous for his hedge fund management and significant contributions to various causes through his Open Society Foundations. However, he is not associated with the ownership or founding of Two Sigma Investments.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Since Two Sigma Investments is owned by its founders, John Overdeck and David Siegel, and not by George Soros, the statement is factually incorrect.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 0, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.2}
{"claim": "NASA always receives blessings from the Pope and that God\u2019s permission must be sought before a space mission.", "label": "Refuted", "result": {"response": "To assess the factual accuracy of the statement, let's break it down step-by-step using the provided knowledge points.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statement**: The statement claims that NASA always receives blessings from the Pope and that God's permission must be sought before a space mission. This implies a religious endorsement and a requirement for divine approval for NASA's operations.\n\n2. **Analyzing the First Part**: The claim that \"NASA always receives blessings from the Pope\" suggests a consistent and formal relationship between NASA and the Vatican. While there have been instances where the Pope has expressed interest in space exploration and has met with astronauts, there is no formal requirement or established practice that NASA must receive blessings from the Pope for its missions.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Second Part**: The assertion that \"God\u2019s permission must be sought before a space mission\" implies a religious obligation that NASA must fulfill. NASA is a scientific organization that operates based on empirical evidence and scientific principles, not religious mandates. There is no documented requirement for NASA to seek divine permission before launching missions.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Both parts of the statement suggest a religious framework that does not align with the operational practices of NASA. NASA operates independently of religious institutions and does not have a formal process for seeking blessings or divine permission for its missions.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the statement is not accurate.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 0, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.2}

Therefore, the claim that Biden supports \"open borders\" is misleading.\n\n2. **Sanctuary Cities**: The knowledge does not specifically address Biden's stance on sanctuary cities. However, it is known that Biden has generally supported policies that protect undocumented immigrants, which may align with the concept of sanctuary cities, but this is not explicitly confirmed in the provided information.\n\n3. **Free Lawyers**: The knowledge does not mention Biden's position on providing free legal representation for undocumented immigrants. This aspect of the statement lacks supporting evidence in the provided information.\n\n4. **Health Care for Illegal Immigrants**: The knowledge points out that Biden has stated that people who are sick should not go uncovered, implying a support for health care access for undocumented immigrants. However, it clarifies that the candidates were asked if their health care plans would provide coverage for immigrants in the country illegally, and it did not specify that this coverage would be free. Therefore, the claim that Biden supports \"free health care\" for illegal immigrants is misleading.\n\nIn summary, the statement contains several inaccuracies:\n- Biden does not support open borders as defined in the statement.\n- The claim about sanctuary cities is not directly addressed.\n- There is no evidence provided regarding free lawyers.\n- The health care claim is misleading as it does not clarify the nature of the coverage.\n\nGiven these points, the overall statement is not accurate.\n\nFinal assessment:\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "Analysis: Fact-checking the CNN Trump-Biden debate | PBS News Support PBS News Your generous monthly contribution\u2014 or whatever you can give\u2014will help secure our future.

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, the presumptive presidential nominees, shared a debate stage June 27 for the first time since 2020, in a feisty confrontation that \u2014 thanks to debate rules \u2014 managed to avoid the near-constant interruptions that marred their previous meetings. CNN hosted the debate , which had no audience, at its Atlanta studio. CNN anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash moderated. The debate format allowed CNN to mute candidates' microphones when it wasn't their turn to speak. READ MORE: 3 key moments from CNN's Biden-Trump debate Trump attacked Biden's record, blaming inflation and other issues on Biden's \"insane and stupid policies.\" Biden questioned Trump's conduct, noting that Trump is a convicted felon and saying he has the \"morals of an alley cat.\" Biden and Trump clashed on topics including immigration, the economy, abortion and their ages. Trump's outlandish immigration claim Trump says Biden \"allowed millions of people to come in here from prisons, jails and mental institutions.\" Pants on Fire! Immigration officials arrested about 103,700 noncitizens with criminal convictions (whether in the U.S. or abroad) from fiscal years 2021 to 2024, federal data shows. That accounts for people stopped at and between ports of entry. Not everyone was let in. The term \"noncitizens\" includes people who may have had legal immigration status in the U.S. but were not U.S. citizens. The data reflects the people that the federal government knows about, but it's inexhaustive. However, immigration experts said despite the data's limitations, there is no evidence to support Trump's statement. Biden's close to the mark about immigration reductions Biden: \"I've changed (the law) in the way that now you're in a situation where there are 40 percent fewer people coming across the border illegally.\" Mostly True.

June 28, 2024 5:00 AM ET Sergio Mart\u00ednez-Beltr\u00e1n Guests at the Old Town Pour House watch a debate between President Biden and former President Donald Trump on Thursday in Chicago. The debate is the first of two scheduled between the two candidates before the November election. Scott Olson/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Scott Olson/Getty Images Without a doubt, the issue of immigration is playing a big role in the 2024 presidential campaign \u2014 and it was certainly one of the main points of contention between President Biden and former President Donald Trump in Thursday night's debate. Trump accused Biden of allowing millions of unauthorized migrants to enter the country. He also said many falsehoods about the current state of immigration. 4 takeaways from the first presidential debate Meanwhile, Biden attempted to explain what he would do to continue lowering the number of migrants crossing illegally, despite that number hitting an all-time high during his tenure. Here are three fact checks of claims made during the debate related to immigration: Claim 1: The U.S. Southern border is open This is a talking point used often by Republicans when referring to Biden\u2019s handling of the U.S.-Mexico border. \u201cHe decided to open up our border, open up our country,\u201d Trump said of Biden during the debate. But this is not accurate. It is true that under Biden, unauthorized crossings hit a record high, oftentimes overwhelming certain border communities and straining its resources . But the border is not \"open.\" In fact, it is arguably more reinforced than ever. The federal government has added more sections of the U.S. Southern border walls, and there have been more military operations at the border. The administration has also increased the number of expedited removals. Biden has tried to work with Congress to overhaul the immigration system, but a majority of Republican lawmakers have not moved forward with the Senate $118 billion border agreement .

Buttigieg : \"Our country is healthier when everybody is healthier. And remember, we\u2019re talking about something people are getting a \u2014 given a chance to buy into. In the same way that there are undocumented immigrants in my community who pay, they pay sales taxes, they pay property taxes directly or indirectly. This is not about a handout. This is an insurance program. And we do ourselves no favor by having 11 million undocumented people in our country be unable to access health care.\" Guthrie then asked Biden to comment. Biden : \"You cannot let \u2014 as the mayor said, you cannot let people who are sick, no matter where they come from, no matter what their status, go uncovered. You can\u2019t do that. It\u2019s just going to be taken care of, period. You have to. It\u2019s the humane thing to do. \"But here\u2019s the deal. The deal is that he\u2019s right about three things. Number one, they in fact contribute to the well-being of the country, but they also \u2014 for example, they\u2019ve increased the lifespan of Social Security because they\u2019re \u2014 they have a job. They\u2019re paying the Social Security tax. That\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s increased the lifespan. They would do the same thing in terms of reducing the overall cost of health care by them being able to be treated and not wait until they\u2019re in extremis.\" No other candidate commented on that question. So all candidates raised their hands affirming they\u2019d have a plan that would offer coverage for immigrants in the country illegally. But the question did not directly ask if coverage would be free. Buttigieg specifically said people would buy the coverage, and that it was \"not about a handout.\" Biden in his answer spoke about the contributions of immigrants in the country illegally \u2014 and said that if they had health care coverage, they\u2019d be reducing the cost of the overall health care system. Our ruling A Trump re-election campaign ad said Democratic presidential candidates \"support giving illegal immigrants free healthcare at our expense.\" This is misleading. The claim is based on a raise-your-hand type of question in a June debate. Candidates were asked if their health care plans would provide coverage for immigrants in the country illegally. All candidates raised their hand. But the question did not ask if the coverage would be for free.\nAP FACT CHECK: Examining claims from the last Trump-Biden debate | PBS News Support PBS News Your generous monthly contribution\u2014 or whatever you can give\u2014will help secure our future.

President Donald Trump's first line of the night, about COVID-19 deaths, was false and set the tone as he and Democratic rival Joe Biden unleashed a torrent of claims in their last presidential debate . Trump misrepresented the reality of the pandemic in myriad and familiar ways, insisting against obvious reality that the pandemic is drawing to a close. He also boasted about \"clean\" facilities at the border for migrant children, ignoring the filthy conditions under which they were held in 2018. Biden, at times, was selective on the coronavirus and other matters, at one point stating that no one under Obamacare lost private health coverage. Millions did. A look at how some of the statements on the stage in Nashville, Tennessee, compared with the facts: CORONAVIRUS TRUMP: \"We're rounding the turn. We're rounding the corner. It's going away.\" THE FACTS: No, the coronavirus isn't going away. It's coming back. New cases are on the rise toward their summer peak. Deaths have also been increasing. According to data through Oct. 21 from Johns Hopkins University, the seven-day rolling average for daily new cases in the U.S. rose over the past two weeks from over 42,300 on Oct. 7 to nearly 60,000 on Oct. 21. In that time the seven-day rolling average for daily new deaths in the U.S. rose from 695 to 757. ___ TRUMP: \"All he does is talk about shutdowns. But forget about him.

{"claim": "CDC announces that ordinary (non-N95) masks (which most people are wearing) will do nothing to protect you against wildfire smoke because they do not catch small particles", "label": "Supported", "result": {"response": "To assess the factual accuracy of the statement regarding the CDC's announcement about ordinary masks and their effectiveness against wildfire smoke, we need to analyze the provided knowledge points.\n\n1. **Types of Masks**: The knowledge discusses three types of masks: medical face masks (surgical masks), KN95 masks, and cloth masks. It highlights that surgical masks are primarily designed for source control to limit the transmission of respiratory droplets, while KN95 masks provide a higher level of filtration.\n\n2. **Effectiveness Against Particles**: The knowledge does not specifically address the effectiveness of these masks against wildfire smoke or small particles. However, it does mention that cloth masks and surgical masks are not designed to filter out small particles effectively, which is relevant to the claim about wildfire smoke.\n\n3. **General Efficacy of Masks**: The knowledge points out that the efficacy of masks against respiratory viral infections is unproven by high-quality trials and that masks can pose various risks. This suggests that while masks may provide some level of protection against larger respiratory droplets, they may not be effective against smaller particles, such as those found in smoke.\n\n4. **CDC Guidelines**: The knowledge does not provide specific CDC guidelines regarding the use of ordinary masks against wildfire smoke. However, it is widely known that N95 masks are recommended for filtering out small particles, including those from smoke, while ordinary masks (like cloth or surgical masks) are not.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the statement that \"CDC announces that ordinary (non-N95) masks (which most people are wearing) will do nothing to protect you against wildfire smoke because they do not catch small particles\" aligns with the general understanding of mask efficacy against small particles, even though the specific CDC announcement is not directly referenced in the knowledge provided.\n\nThus, the conclusion is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"True\"\n}\n```", "answer": "True"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Tested Face Masks Three different types of face masks were tested: A medical face mask (also known as a surgical mask) conform with the European Union\u2019s health and safety standards (CE mark): This type of face mask is typically used by health care workers, ensuring a barrier that limits the transition of an infective agent between the hospital staff and the patient. During the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical face masks have been recommended as a means of source control for persons who are either symptomatic or asymptomatic to prevent the spread of respiratory droplets produced by coughing or sneezing. The application of medical masks as source control has been shown to decrease the release of respiratory droplets carrying respiratory viruses (Leung et al. , 2020) and they are recommended for the reduction of transmission of influenza (Cheng et al. , 2010; MacIntyre and Chughtai, 2015; MacIntyre et al. , 2015). Medical masks comply with requirements defined in European Standard EN 14683:2019 (European Committee for Standardization, 2019). KN95 with a one-way valve: N95 is an American standard managed by NIOSH, which is part of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). KN95 masks are the equivalent Chinese standard for masks. Both N95 and KN95 correspond to the FFP2 code used in the European Union (European Committee for Standardization, 2001) and protect against solid and liquid irritating aerosols with a minimum filter efficiency of 92%. The mask tested in this work included a one-way exhalation valve that makes it easier to breathe through. This type of mask is not recommended as an effective barrier against the SARS-CoV-2 virus because the valve releases unfiltered air when the wearer breathes out and therefore does not prevent the wearer from spreading the virus. It was included in the study to assess the potential impact of the exhalation valve on the concentration of accumulated carbon dioxide. Cloth masks: Since surgical and FFP2 masks were sometimes difficult to find at the beginning of the pandemic and, especially the FFP2 masks should be reserved for health care providers, cloth masks have become popular during the pandemic as they are cheap, easy to find or to make and can be washed and reused. Cloth masks can be made from common materials, such as sheets made of tightly woven cotton, and should include multiple layers of fabric. There are no standards or regulations for self-made cloth face masks.\nunproven efficacy in disrupting the transmission of respiratory viruses and their adverse social consequences. Introduction Facemasks covering the entrances to the airways were widely mandated during the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, not only for healthcare workers but also for the general population ( 1 ). Professions with frequent human contact were obligated to wear them for long periods as were schoolchildren ( 1 \u2013 6 ). This raises reasonable concerns: first, because use by the general population is associated with a higher risk of improper handling of the mask ( 7 \u2013 11 ); secondly because their efficacy against respiratory viral infections is unproven by high quality trials, which indicate little or no effect ( 12 , 13 ) and thirdly, because masks are assumed only to have positive effects ( 14 \u2013 16 ). In reality there is strong evidence that masks pose various risks, especially for pregnant women, children and adolescents, as well as older adults and the unwell ( 14 , 16 \u2013 19 ). They have several demonstrably adverse effects, affecting physiology ( 14 , 16 , 19 \u2013 23 ), psychology ( 16 , 24 ) and, most obviously, social interactions ( 25 \u2013 35 ). Effects on childhood development are a particular concern. These adverse effects have been recently summarised as the so-called mask-induced exhaustion syndrome MIES ( 14 , 16 , 19 ). Interestingly, Spira ( 36 ) and F\u00f6gen ( 37 ) found significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality rates in the mask-wearing cohorts: explanations are uncertain, but viral trapping and recycling are plausible. A further concern, encompassed within MIES, relates to the potential adverse microbiological consequences of wearing face masks. Owing to the creation of a warm, moist micro-environment ( 38 \u2013 41 ), bacteria, fungi and even viruses may accumulate on both sides of the worn masks ( 42 \u2013 46 ). So far, these aspects have not been evaluated in depth. The aim of our pilot study was to assess, visualise and categorise the general ability of masks to accumulate bacteria when used by the general population. This also with regard to a risk assessment, using worst-case consideration which is necessary in such a protective approach ( 47 ). Accordingly, we undertook a microbiological exploration with random samples of face masks as used by members of the general population, together with a systematic rapid literature review.

Johns said the organization estimates about 28,000 of its current members could take part in such a plan, many of whom are farmers who buy their own health insurance. But anyone can join the Iowa Farm Bureau if they pay annual dues of $55 or less, making the option available to almost anyone in the state. Currently, Medica is the only insurance provider in Iowa's individual marketplace, which is where about 46,500 Iowans purchase health insurance if they are not offered it through their employer or through a government program. That's down from about 72,000 last year. About 41,700 of Medica's Iowa customers have incomes low enough to qualify for Affordable Care Act subsidies, which help pay their health-insurance premiums. The new Farm Bureau plans would not qualify for such subsidies. A national expert said the consumers most likely to benefit from the proposal are young, healthy Iowans who make too much money to qualify for Affordable Care Act subsidies. \"I think the people who would really get nailed here are the people who are older or have pre-existing conditions \u2014 and who don't qualify for the subsidies,\" said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University Health Policy Institute in Washington, D.C.

Corlette noted that the Farm Bureau in Tennessee has continued to sell old-style health insurance , despite the Affordable Care Act. Pre-existing health conditions are considered when premiums are set for those plans. The Tennessee arrangement skirts Affordable Care Act regulations, which apply to state-regulated health insurance. Tennessee exempted the Farm Bureau plans from its state regulations, and Iowa's proposal would do the same thing, Corlette noted. Corlette said Tennesseeans who buy the Farm Bureau coverage have had to pay federal penalties, because their policies don't qualify as full health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, which requires most Americans to have insurance. However, the Trump administration has decided to no longer force Americans to pay such penalties, so Iowans who buy the new Farm Bureau plans would not face such a barrier."}], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 1, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.2}

These regulations often target specific forms of packaging, such as sachets and polythene bags, which are commonly used for low-cost alcoholic beverages.\n\n2. **Health and Safety Concerns**: The ban on sachet and polythene packaging for alcohol is often motivated by health concerns, as these types of packaging can lead to increased consumption of cheap and potentially harmful alcoholic products.\n\n3. **State-Level Variations**: It's important to note that regulations can vary by state within Nigeria. Some states have enacted bans on sachet alcohol, while others may not have such restrictions in place.\n\n4. **Recent Developments**: As of my last knowledge update in October 2023, there have been ongoing discussions and implementations of bans on sachet alcohol in various regions of Nigeria, reflecting a trend towards stricter control over alcohol sales.\n\nGiven these points, the statement that the Nigerian government had placed a ban on alcohol in sachet and polythene is generally accurate, as there have been bans implemented in various states for health and safety reasons.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"True\"\n}\n```", "answer": "True"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 0, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.2}

This could be due to natural phenomena such as sunsets, wildfires, or atmospheric conditions.\n\n2. **Key Points from Knowledge**: \n   - The sky can appear orange or red during certain times of the day, particularly during sunrise and sunset due to the scattering of light.\n   - Atmospheric conditions, such as smoke from wildfires or pollution, can also cause the sky to take on these colors.\n   - There have been instances in the past where wildfires have caused dramatic changes in sky color, leading to orange and red hues.\n\n3. **Contextual Analysis**: \n   - The statement does not specify a particular time frame or event, but it is plausible that there have been occurrences where the sky has turned orange to blood red due to natural causes.\n   - Recent events, such as wildfires in the western United States, have indeed led to skies turning these colors.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the context and the natural phenomena that can cause such sky colors, the statement is likely true.

{"claim": "The NFL, NBA and MLB have Tax-Exempt status.", "label": "Refuted", "result": {"response": "To assess the factual accuracy of the statement \"The NFL, NBA and MLB have Tax-Exempt status,\" we need to analyze the relevant knowledge points regarding tax-exempt status and the nature of these leagues.\n\n1. **Understanding Tax-Exempt Status**: Tax-exempt status typically refers to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, which is generally reserved for charitable organizations. However, some organizations can have different types of tax-exempt status or special tax considerations.\n\n2. **NFL, NBA, and MLB**: \n   - The **NFL** (National Football League) is a professional football league in the United States. It was previously classified as a tax-exempt organization but lost that status in 2015.\n   - The **NBA** (National Basketball Association) is a professional basketball league. It is not tax-exempt; it operates as a for-profit entity.\n   - The **MLB** (Major League Baseball) is a professional baseball league. Similar to the NFL, it was previously classified as a tax-exempt organization but has since changed its structure and is not tax-exempt.\n\n3. **Current Status**: As of the latest information, none of these leagues hold tax-exempt status. The NFL and MLB were previously tax-exempt but have since moved to for-profit structures. The NBA has never been tax-exempt.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement that \"The NFL, NBA and MLB have Tax-Exempt status\" is inaccurate.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "changes, beginning in 2025, unless otherwise noted.

Throughout her career, she made numerous statements and rulings that reflect her commitment to protecting the rights of individuals, particularly marginalized groups.\n\n3. **Fact-Checking the Quote**: There is no credible evidence or record of Ruth Bader Ginsburg ever making such a statement. In fact, her judicial philosophy and public statements consistently opposed any form of exploitation or harm to children. \n\n4. **Reputation and Legacy**: Ginsburg's legacy is one of fighting against discrimination and advocating for the rights of the oppressed. A statement like the one attributed to her would be completely contrary to her values and public persona.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of evidence supporting the claim and the inconsistency of the statement with Ginsburg's known beliefs and actions, we can conclude that the statement is false.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 0, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.2}
{"claim": "Nigeria\u2019s urban population at the time of independence was approximately 7 million", "label": "Supported", "result": {"response": "To assess the factual accuracy of the statement regarding Nigeria's urban population at the time of independence, we need to analyze the provided knowledge points.\n\n1. **Historical Context**: Nigeria gained independence in 1960. The knowledge points do not provide specific urban population figures for Nigeria in 1960, but they do indicate a historical trend of urban population growth from that year onward.\n\n2. **Urban Population Growth**: The knowledge points indicate that the share of urban population in Nigeria was 15.41% in 1960. However, they do not provide the total population of Nigeria at that time, which is necessary to calculate the urban population.\n\n3. **Population Estimates**: To determine if the urban population was approximately 7 million in 1960, we would need to know the total population of Nigeria in that year. According to historical data, Nigeria's total population in 1960 was around 45 million. If we apply the urban percentage (15.41%) to this total population, we can estimate the urban population:\n   - Urban Population = Total Population \u00d7 Urban Percentage\n   - Urban Population = 45,000,000 \u00d7 0.1541 \u2248 6,949,500\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The calculated urban population of approximately 6.95 million aligns closely with the statement that Nigeria's urban population at the time of independence was approximately 7 million.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the statement is accurate.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"True\"\n}\n```", "answer": "True"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "Urban population (% of total population) - Nigeria | Data Urban population (% of total population) - Nigeria World Urbanization Prospects, United Nations ( UN ), uri: population.un.org/wup , note: United Nations Population Division's World Urbanization Prospects, National definitions, publisher: UN Population Division License : CC BY-4.0 Label Selected Countries and Economies Country Most Recent Year Most Recent Value All Countries and Economies Country Most Recent Year Most Recent Value Help us improve this site Help / Feedback IBRD IDA IFC MIGA ICSID Legal Privacy Notice Access to Information Jobs Contact \u00a9 2026 The World Bank Group, All Rights Reserved.

They argue that extending the deadline will undermine public confidence in the results, which could be delayed for weeks . They also insist, without evidence, that it will raise the potential for fraud \u2014 a position President Trump has taken repeatedly .

Ethan Miller/Getty Images Susie Sonneborn of Montclair, N.J., says she tried to be extra-careful to make sure her ballot was postmarked on time when she voted in a mayoral race in May. But when she heard that more than 1,100 ballots \u2014 9% of the total \u2014 had been rejected, she checked with the local election office and was shocked to discover that hers was one of them. \"It was just really disappointing and surprising that by following the instructions that are printed on the ballot, I was set up for\nAuthorized Representative for Emergency Absentee Ballot Form Frequently Asked Questions What if I requested a mail-in or absentee ballot but I didn't receive a ballot, lost my ballot, or changed my mind and want to vote in-person? If you already submitted a mail-in or absentee ballot, you cannot vote at your polling place on Election Day. If you did not return your mail-in or absentee ballot and you want to vote in person, you have two options: Bring your ballot and the pre-addressed outer return envelope to your polling place to be voided. After you surrender your ballot and envelope and sign a declaration, you can then vote a regular ballot. If you don't surrender your ballot and return envelope, you can only vote by provisional ballot at your polling place. Your county election board will then verify that you did not vote by mail before counting your provisional ballot. How do I know if my ballot was accepted and counted? You can track the status of your ballot online . If you provide your email address to your county election office at the time you register to vote or apply for a mail ballot, you may receive an email notification when your returned ballot is received, as well as information about your ballot status, depending on county practices. You can call your county elections office for more information. Why are there two envelopes with my mail-in ballot? The smaller secrecy envelope is intended to protect the anonymity of your\nballots \u2014 more than 1.3% of the total \u2014 were rejected in the state's March primary for a variety of reasons, including missed deadlines. The lawsuit argues that mail-in ballots should have to be only postmarked \u2014 not received \u2014 by 7 p.m. on Election Day. Kirk Nielsen, one of 10 plaintiffs in the case, says the fate of a ballot is out of a voter's hands once it goes in the mail. His was one of thousands of ballots rejected in the state in 2018. Nielsen says he mailed it eight days before Election Day, but it was not received until eight days after. He worries about being disenfranchised again. 2020 Election: Secure Your Vote This November, Election Night Could Stretch Into Election Week Or Month \"I want to vote by mail this year because of the pandemic. I don't want to get sick at a crowded polling place and I don't want to contribute to spreading the virus by going to a crowded polling place, but that said, I think there's an even greater risk this year voting by mail that my mail ballot might not be counted, along with thousands of others,\" Nielsen says. His case is scheduled to be heard this month, but Republicans were heartened by the judge's refusal to issue a preliminary injunction against the state's mail-in rules. The judge said the Election Day receipt deadline \"eliminates the problem of missing, unclear, or even altered postmarks, eliminates delay that can have adverse consequences, and eliminates the remote possibility that in an extremely close election \u2014 Florida has had some \u2014 a person who did not vote on or before Election Day can fill out and submit a ballot later.\" These are all arguments that Republicans have made in defense of keeping the Election Day deadline currently in place in most states. 2020 Election: Secure Your Vote Chaos In Primary Elections Raises Fears For November \"Allowing massive amounts of ballots to arrive or the counting to continue well after Election Day really allows room for fraud,\" says Mandi Merritt, national press secretary for the Republican National Committee. \"It allows losing candidates or other partisan operatives to go find more late votes that could potentially change the legitimate outcome of an election and really just leaves room for unnecessary litigation.\" While Merritt did not offer an example, she says even the possibility of fraud would undermine\nregistered voter will receive a ballot in the mail for the upcoming election. However, five of those states (Colorado, Oregon, Utah, Hawaii and Washington) have been holding their elections primarily by mail since before the pandemic, so voters who register in these states do so knowing they\u2019ll likely submit their ballot by mail. The four remaining states (California, Vermont, Nevada, and New Jersey) plus Washington DC switched this year \u2014 so, voters there who were already registered didn\u2019t actively request a mail-in ballot for this election.

The five places that changed their policies for this election to send ballots to all voters \u2013 DC , California , Vermont, Nevada and New Jersey \u2013 have at least 29 million registered voters by the latest available count. Based on this data, the number of truly unsolicited ballots sent out is at most, around half of what the President claims, and likely even less. It\u2019s also worth noting that even in the unsolicited instances, states have safeguards in place to prevent the kind of fraud Trump implies will result from the projected increase in voting by mail this election.

The pandemic this year has raised concerns about large groups of voters gathering indoors, so some additional states \u2014 California, Nevada, New Jersey, Vermont plus Washington, D.C. \u2014 have decided to send ballots to all active voters. In other states, voters have to take action to request a mail ballot, though some of them took that step already if they live in a state that allows a permanent absentee voting list that may be offered to all voters, or only to certain voters based on specific criteria such as age or disability. We asked the Trump campaign to show how it arrived at 80 million unsolicited ballots, and whether that included a handful of states that have generally held all vote-by-mail elections for years. We did not receive a response. It\u2019s possible that Trump or an aide saw a prediction in an August New York Times article that \"80 million mail ballots will flood election offices this fall.\" However, that figure isn\u2019t limited to voters who will be sent \"unsolicited\" ballots. It includes voters who will have to request a mail ballot. The New York Times found that ballots will be mailed directly to about 44 million voters in nine states and D.C. So that\u2019s a little more than half of the figure Trump cited. WRAL partners with PolitiFact NC to fact check political stories University of Florida political scientist Michael McDonald found a similar total number of ballots \u2014 44.4 million \u2014 that will be sent in states conducting all-mail elections. He also counted Montana, where Gov. Steve Bullock used his emergency powers to allow counties to opt in to holding an all-mail election. As of late August, most Montana counties opted for all mail. Paul Gronke, an expert on voting by mail at Reed College, predicted somewhere north of 80 million ballots will be cast by mail, double 2016\u2019s total. In D.C. and the states that decided to send ballots to all voters this year due to the pandemic, many of those voters would have likely requested a ballot anyway or were on permanent absentee-ballot lists. For example, in California in 2016, there were 13 million ballots cast, including 7 million absentee. Gronke added up how many ballots were cast by absentee during the 2016 elections in California, Nevada, New Jersey and Vermont and concluded at most, 7.5 million"}], "source": "rag_only"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 5, "concluded_by_rag": true, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.2}

By Linda Qiu July 14, 2014 Red foxes may roam all over Canada but you won\u2019t catch the conservative news network there, according to an Internet meme circulating since 2011. One version of the meme states that Fox New Channel is \"banned from operating in Canada\" because \"it\u2019s illegal in Canada to lie on airwaves.\" A reader sent the message to us and asked us to check it out. A mountie of lies We weren\u2019t able to verify the origins of the meme, though Bill O\u2019Reilly himself said in 2004 that Fox wasn\u2019t allowed in Canada -- not that he agreed with the lying part. The earliest iteration of the full claim we found comes from a Feb. 28, 2011, Huffington Post blog post by liberal radio host and activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \"The (false news) provision has kept Fox News and right wing talk radio out of Canada and helped make Canada a model for liberal democracy and freedom,\" wrote Kennedy. \"As a result of that law, Canadians enjoy high-quality news coverage including the kind of foreign affairs and investigative journalism that flourished in this country before Ronald Reagan abolished the \u2018Fairness Doctrine\u2019 in 1987.\" What Kennedy is likely referring to are provisions in Canadian broadcast policy, include the Radio Act and other policies, that prohibit \"any false or misleading news.\" These provisions against spreading misinformation used to be part of Canada\u2019s criminal code, according to Canadian media lawyer Paul Schabas. They were famously evoked to send Holocaust denier and neo-Nazi publisher Ernst Z\u00fcndel to trial in the 1980s. After the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that the code violated freedom of expression rights and thus was unconstitutional, the false news provisions were just regulations.

You could ask the person you\u2019re dialoguing with, does that wording sound like they want to reduce abortion, or in fact increase access to it? Why would Planned Parenthood promote, endorse, and financially support certain candidates, unless they knew that it would be financially beneficial for them to see those candidates win their elections? Randy writes, \u201cUnfortunately, any support of the abortion industry, which has no financial interest in keeping abortion rare\u2014in fact, quite the opposite\u2014only bolsters it.\u201d Notice that the Democratic party platform says nothing about keeping abortion rare; only \u201csafe\u201d and \u201clegal.\u201d (Compare this with the Republican platform .) To summarize: on the one hand, we have the good news that the abortion rate is continuing to decrease over time, and that the occupant of the White House isn\u2019t the only important factor when it comes to abortion rates. We know that the pro-life movement is making a big difference. On the other hand, we can\u2019t say that the abortion policies of the President don\u2019t matter; they do have power to set the course and direction of our country, impact state policies, and to either discourage or encourage the abortion industry. (And of course, there is also the presidential appointment of judges, and the effects of policies on pro-life ministries and organizations.) Hope this provides some helpful thoughts.

Rating: False About this rating In mid-August 2020, Snopes readers inquired about a meme circulating on Facebook that claimed money given to AARP (formerly American Association of Retired Persons), an advocacy organization that lobbies on behalf of retired Americans, goes \"directly\" to the Democratic party. It's unclear what exactly is meant by the phrase, \"what you pay AARP.\" The organization has an estimated 38 million members, all of whom typically pay annual dues at $16 per year. As a 501(c)4 tax-exempt organization, it also accepts charitable donations. Either way, any money paid to AARP through membership dues or donations does not go \"directly\" to the Democratic party. The AARP lobbies the government on behalf of causes that affect people aged 50 and older. Those activities may include taking a stand on health care and Social Security . In terms of candidates and political parties, however, AARP's official position is that it is non-partisan. The organization states it \"does not support, endorse or contribute to political candidates or parties.\" Instead, per AARP, the organization's role in terms of election politics is \"connecting voters to information about where the candidates stand on issues most important to them including the future of Social Security and other critical issues related to financial security, health and well-being.\" We checked the AARP's federal campaign finance data using the website Open Secrets , a project operated by the government accountability organization The Center for Responsive Politics.

{"claim": "99% of people recover from COVID-19.", "label": "Refuted", "result": {"response": "To assess the factual accuracy of the statement \"99% of people recover from COVID-19,\" we need to analyze the provided knowledge points.\n\n1. **Infection Fatality Rate**: The knowledge indicates that estimates of the infection fatality rate (IFR) for COVID-19 are around 1% according to various experts. This suggests that approximately 99% of people who contract COVID-19 do not die from it.\n\n2. **Hospitalization and Long-term Effects**: The knowledge also mentions that a significant number of people who contract COVID-19 experience hospitalization (14% of cases) and that some may suffer long-term effects even if they recover. This indicates that while many may recover, the experience of recovery can vary significantly in terms of health outcomes.\n\n3. **Context of Recovery**: The statement implies a straightforward recovery without acknowledging the potential for long-term health issues that some individuals may face after recovering from COVID-19. The knowledge points out that some individuals report lingering symptoms and complications, which complicates the notion of \"recovery.\"\n\n4. **Comparison to Other Countries**: The knowledge discusses the case fatality rate in the U.S. compared to other countries, but it does not provide a direct percentage of recovery rates. However, the implication is that a large majority do recover, aligning with the statement.\n\nIn summary, while the statement \"99% of people recover from COVID-19\" aligns with the infection fatality rate suggesting that 99% do not die, it oversimplifies the recovery process by not considering the potential for long-term health issues. Therefore, while the statement can be seen as generally true in terms of survival, it lacks nuance regarding the quality of recovery.\n\nGiven this analysis, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"True\"\n}\n```", "answer": "True"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "\u2014 suggest an infection fatality rate of 1.2%, as Jha explained in a Twitter thread . Based on several studies in various countries, the World Health Organization\u2019s chief scientist, Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, said on July 2 that the infection fatality rate is about 0.6% \u2014 at least for now, according to the New York Times . Jha said he thinks the rate \u201cshould come down over time because we\u2019re getting better at treating COVID.\u201d \u201cAnd so somebody who spends three weeks in the ICU, has severe lung damage and would have died two months ago might now survive,\u201d he said. \u201cBut let\u2019s be very clear, that if you spent three weeks in the ICU, have severe, diffuse lung damage and you survive, it\u2019s fabulous that you survived. That was not inconsequential.\u201d Even if the infection fatality rate is about 1%, that\u2019s \u201cstill a lot of people,\u201d Dr. Lee Riley , professor and chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us. \u201c I\u2019m more concerned about the actual numbers of people who are dying rather than the percent.\u201d As of July 6, that figure was 130,208 deaths in the United States , according to Johns Hopkins\u2019 figures. \u201cWhatever the proportion, we\u2019ve had over 130,000 deaths in the US so far,\u201d Morse, at Columbia University, said, \u201cmore than twice as many as died in the Vietnam War, and more than died in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan combined, but I don\u2019t think war could be called \u201899% harmless\u2019.\u201d McEnany said in the July 6 press briefing that Trump\u2019s claim was a reference to \u201cthe fact that mortality in this country is very low.\u201d And the case \u201cfatality rate in this country, vis-a-vis other European countries, is much lower than, let\u2019s say, France and Italy.\u201d The U.S., at 4.5%, does have a lower case fatality rate than France (14.6%) and Italy (14.4%), as well as other countries, but a higher rate than many countries, too. But McEnany\u2019s explanation doesn\u2019t support what Trump said, in claiming 99% of coronavirus cases are \u201ctotally harmless.\u201d In addition to those who die, many are hospitalized. In June, the CDC published data on the 1.3 million reported cases in the U.S. from Jan. 22 to May 30, finding: \u201cOverall, 184,673 (14%) patients were hospitalized, 29,837 (2%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and\n\u201ctotally harmless.\u201d In addition to those who die, many are hospitalized. In June, the CDC published data on the 1.3 million reported cases in the U.S. from Jan. 22 to May 30, finding: \u201cOverall, 184,673 (14%) patients were hospitalized, 29,837 (2%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and 71,116 (5%) died.\u201d A study published in late February by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention similarly found that 14% of cases in mainland China were severe and 5% were critical. The latter category included \u201crespiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure.\u201d The WHO also says that 13.8% of confirmed coronavirus patients have severe disease and 6.1% have critical cases. Beyond the harm caused by being sick and hospitalized, there are the financial ramifications of that treatment, the impact on hospitals of the pandemic and the burden to the U.S. health system, Riley said. And even those who have mild symptoms may transmit the infection to others. \u201cThey can still pass it on to others, who may get sick or even (tragically) die,\u201d Morse said. Lingering and Long-Term Effects Not much is known about how frequently COVID-19 patients suffer long-term effects, but there are signs that the disease does not always completely resolve itself as rapidly as expected \u2014 and is unlikely to be described as \u201charmless\u201d by many who are affected. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any long-term data because the virus has only been around for a little while,\u201d said Harvard\u2019s Jha. \u201cBut we certainly are seeing more and more cases of people with \u2026 lingering symptoms.\u201d According to the WHO, it takes about two weeks for a person to recover from a mild case of COVID-19, and three to six weeks to recover from a severe or critical one. Anecdotally, however, some patients \u2014 even those with mild cases \u2014 report months of extreme fatigue or on-and-off again symptoms such as headaches , brain fog or shortness of breath that make daily life difficult. These so-called \u201clong-haulers,\u201d as some call themselves, have shared their stories in online support groups and with journalists . One patient in the U.K. told The Atlantic that her case might be \u201cmild relative to dying in a hospital, but this virus has ruined my life.\u201d Without more data, it\u2019s difficult to know how common these complaints are or why they might be happening, but similar types of symptoms have\nthe Philippines has reported 360,775 cases, of which 310,642 are of recoveries while 6,690 are of deaths. The latest reproduction number of COVID-19 is 0.93 , which means that an infected individual can pass on the virus to less than one person. (See VERA FILES FACT SHEET: COVID-19 numbers used in measuring success of gov\u2019t response explained ) Filipinos from various sectors, including medical workers, have been infected with COVID-19. As of Oct. 19 , 10,851 health workers have fallen ill to the virus, with 10,088 already recovered, 429 with active cases, and 64 deaths. Other government institutions also publicize their list of COVID-19 positive personnel. In the House of Representatives, 85 were confirmed cases, including 10 representatives, with 70 recoveries and five deaths, including two representatives , as of Oct. 3. In the Senate, four senators have contracted the virus. On March 12 and June 2 3, access to the Senate building had to be restricted because some staffers and resource persons tested positive for COVID-19. Some high-ranking Cabinet officials also caught COVID-19. Interior Secretary Eduardo A\u00f1o, vice chair of the National Task Force Against COVID-19, got infected twice , in March and August . Others were Education Secretary Leonor Briones who tested positive in March and Public Works Secretary Mark Villar, also the chief isolation czar , in July.

But President Donald Trump falsely claimed \u201c99%\u201d of cases \u201care totally harmless.\u201d The president, according to his press secretary, was referring to the case fatality rate, and he claimed the amount of testing the U.S. has conducted showed this. The testing actually shows a case fatality rate of 4.5% , but not everyone who has contracted COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, has been tested. Some estimates say the fatality rate among those infected is likely around 1%. Asked whether cases that don\u2019t result in death are \u201charmless,\u201d White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said : \u201cThe president was noting the fact that the vast majority of Americans who contract coronavirus will come out on the other side of this.\u201d \u201cSome estimates do place the mortality at about 1%,\u201d Columbia University epidemiologist Stephen Morse told us in an email, noting that we don\u2019t have a solid figure for the total number of people who have been infected. \u201cHowever, 1% mortality is not the same as \u201899% \u2026 totally harmless\u2019. I wish that were true. \u2018Totally harmless\u2019 suggests that the infection doesn\u2019t do any harm.\u201d In addition to patients who get sick enough to need hospitalization, some who have recovered from COVID-19 report experiencing long-term effects, \u201cincluding lung damage but also other symptoms, and we don\u2019t know how common these sequelae (the term for aftereffects of disease) are,\u201d Morse said. Trump made his claim in July 4 remarks at the White House. \u201cLikewise, testing \u2014 there were no tests for a new virus, but now we have tested almost 40 million people,\u201d he said . \u201cBy so doing, we show cases, 99% of which are totally harmless. Results that no other country can show, because no other country has testing that we have \u2014 not in terms of the numbers or in terms of the quality.\u201d The president exaggerated the number of tests a bit: 36.3 million had been conducted as of July 3, according to the CDC. The COVID Tracking Project had the total at 34.9 million as of July 4. What those tests show\npatient in the U.K. told The Atlantic that her case might be \u201cmild relative to dying in a hospital, but this virus has ruined my life.\u201d Without more data, it\u2019s difficult to know how common these complaints are or why they might be happening, but similar types of symptoms have been reported in the wake of other viral infections, including SARS . One hypothesis is that the lingering symptoms are the result of the immune system still reacting to the virus, even if infectious virus is long gone from the body. Experts also have concerns that some proportion of those who survive severe COVID-19 infections may be left with organ damage. \u201cThe amount of lung damage that we\u2019re seeing in a lot of CAT scans make me very worried about functional capacity and long-term lung function in a lot of these people who survive,\u201d Jha said. \u201cAnd so my best guess \u2014 and it is just a guess \u2014 is a sizable minority of people who end up getting infected, I don\u2019t know, 10, 20% of people will end up having meaningful long-term clinical effects of this virus.\u201d The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute launched an observational study in June to investigate the long-term health effects of having been hospitalized with COVID-19, with a special focus on the heart and lungs. Dr. Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, was asked about Trump\u2019s \u201ctotally harmless\u201d claim on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on July 5 . Hahn wouldn\u2019t say whether the president was wrong. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into who is right and who is wrong,\u201d he said. \u201c[W]hat I will say is that we have data in the White House task force. Those data show us that this is a serious problem.

Zarah Buhari and Kiki Osinbajo, were in the fore among Nigerian influencers who kicked against the abominable acts of the defunct SARS. The two young ladies had through their separate Instagram accounts thrown support for the campaign to end brutality against citizens traced to the unit. Nigerians have for long mounted #EndSARS campaign, providing verifiable evidence of brutality, extra-judicial killing, torture and all forms of inhuman treatment meted on fellow Nigerians by SARS operatives, who dressed more like armed bandits, than wear any official anti-crime paraphernalia. Although the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, had penultimate week announced the disbandment, he immediately reinstated the ban through a statement by the Force Public Relations Officer (FPRO), DCP Frank Mba, but succumbed to pressure and again personally issued a statement disbanding the notorious unit yesterday. Two of his predecessors had three times in the past disbanded SARS, but the notorious outfit swung back almost immediately, fueling speculation that the last has not yet been heard of the dreaded police unit. In mounting pressure for the outfit to be kicked out, Kiki Osinbajo had posted a picture on her Instagram handle showing a clenched fist with the caption, \u201cPOLICE BRUTALITY MUST END NOW. #endpolicebrutality #endsars\u201d.

The Yale -educated lawyer has held an array of positions at law firms, financial institutions, and lobbying firms that have raised questions about whether he has profited from his father\u2019s position. He has admitted to decades-long addictions to alcohol and cocaine. In 2023 the U.S. Justice Department named a special counsel to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s conduct. The following year he was convicted of three federal felony charges that related to his purchase of a handgun while using narcotics in 2018. Also in 2024 he pleaded guilty to nine federal tax charges. However, in December 2024 Hunter Biden was pardoned by his father. Early life and education The Biden boys (From left) Beau Biden, U.S. Sen. Joe Biden, and Hunter Biden at an event on the South Lawn of the White House in 1982. (more) Hunter Biden is the second of three children born to Joe Biden and his first wife, Neilia Hunter Biden. On December 18, 1972, Neilia Biden and infant daughter Naomi were killed in a car accident while on the way to pick out a Christmas tree . Hunter and his elder brother, Joseph Robinette (\u201c Beau \u201d) Biden III, who was known as Beau in the family, were critically injured. Among other injuries, Hunter suffered a broken skull and brain injuries. Joe Biden, who had been elected to the U.S. Senate six weeks earlier, took the oath of office in his sons\u2019 hospital room. In 1977 Joe Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs , who became Hunter and Beau\u2019s stepmother. Jill and Joe Biden have a daughter, Ashley Blazer Biden, who was born in 1981. Hunter Biden attended Archmere Academy, a Roman Catholic high school in Claymont, Delaware, following in the footsteps of his father and elder brother. He spent his first year of college at the University of Pennsylvania , then enrolled in Georgetown University in 1988, where he graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in history in 1992. After graduation, he moved on to Portland , Oregon , and he served in the Jesuit Volunteer Corps , where he met Kathleen Buhle. Three months into their relationship, Buhle became pregnant; the two were married in July 1993, and their daughter Naomi King Biden was born in December. They had two more daughters: Finnegan, born in 1998, and Maisy, born in 2000. To complete his education, Biden enrolled\norganization, explained earlier this month that under this model, in effect from 2021 to 2023, \u201cparticipating Medicare Part D prescription drug plans covered at least one of each dosage form and type of insulin product at no more than $35 per month,\u201d and \u201cless than half of all Part D plans chose to participate in each year.\u201d But in 2022, Biden signed a law that required all Medicare prescription drug plans to cap all insulin products at $35. The law also capped the out-of-pocket price for insulin that\u2019s covered under Medicare Part B, which covers drugs administered in a health care provider\u2019s office. The caps went into effect last year. STAT, a news site that covers health care issues, reported that the idea for a $35 cap for seniors initially came from Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical company, which proposed it in 2019. Trump on Biden Tax Plan \u201cHe\u2019s the only one I know he wants to raise your taxes by four times,\u201d Trump said of Biden. \u201cHe wants to raise everybody\u2019s taxes by four times. He wants the Trump tax cuts to expire. So everybody \u2026 [is] going to pay four to five times \u2013 nobody ever heard of this before.\u201d Trump regularly warns of massive tax hikes for \u201ceverybody,\u201d should Biden be reelected. That doesn\u2019t jibe with anything Biden has proposed. In his more than three years as president, Biden\u2019s major tax changes have included setting a minimum corporate tax rate of 15% and lowering taxes for some families by expanding the child tax credit and, for a time, making it fully refundable, meaning families could still receive a refund even if they no longer owe additional taxes. As we wrote in 2020, when Trump made a similar claim, Biden proposed during that campaign to raise an additional $4 trillion in taxes over the next decade, although the increases would have fallen mainly on very high-income earners and corporations. The plan would not have doubled or tripled people\u2019s taxes at any income level (on average), according to analyses of Biden\u2019s plan by the Penn Wharton Budget Model , the Tax Policy Center and the Tax Foundation . In March 2023, the TPC\u2019s Howard Gleckman wrote that Biden proposed a 2024 budget that would, on average, increase after-tax incomes for low-income households and \u201cleave them effectively unchanged for middle-income households.\u201d The Tax Policy Center noted, \u201cThe top 1 percent, with\nshouldn\u2019t have to go beg\u2019: A protest over insulin prices is seen as a fight\u2026 Recommended New rule would force PBMs to disclose drug rebates\u2026 New rule would force PBMs to disclose drug rebates and other fees Newsom files a civil rights complaint against CMS\u2019 Oz\u2026 Newsom files a civil rights complaint against CMS\u2019 Oz in latest feud with the Trump administration Trump\u2019s addiction initiative brings bold rhetoric but few details Trump\u2019s addiction initiative brings bold rhetoric but few details Recommended Stories Politics Bob Herman STAT Plus: Trump administration signals there\u2019s widespread desire to curb Medicare Advantage Biotech Jason Mast STAT Plus: FDA halts gene therapy trials after brain tumor found in patient Advertisement Politics Katie Palmer STAT Plus: Senators raise concerns about TrumpRx in letter to HHS watchdog The Readout Meghana Keshavan STAT Plus: Launch of Wegovy pill looks to be going strong so far The Readout Elaine Chen STAT Plus: New startup to develop a GLP-1 drug for addiction\npossible awareness or involvement in the business dealings of his son including alleged financial wrongdoing and corruption. The Long Recovery Hunter Biden\u2019s last words to his brother in 2015 were the same as the first he\u2019d heard from him 42 years earlier. And after his illness and death, he \u201ccompletely unraveled,\u201d as he told Moby. \u201cIt\u2019s not an excuse, but it is the reason,\u201d he said. Four-year-old Beau Biden, foreground, rests while his father, Joe Biden, center, is sworn in as a U.S. senator from Delaware in a Wilmington hospital, on Jan. 5, 1973. AP file But Beau Biden\u2019s passing only reignited addiction challenges Hunter Biden had faced before. In his 2021 memoir, Hunter said he felt the unresolved trauma both he and his brother dealt with after the accident in 1972 \u201cmanifested themselves differently in each of us,\u201d for the rest of their lives. To blame it for his own substance abuse battles would be a \u201ccop-out,\u201d he wrote, but added later that it took him decades \u201cto acknowledge that original loss, address that original trauma, recognize that original pain.\u201d Reflecting on grief recently in an interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, Joe Biden said that as difficult as losing Beau was for him, it \u201cwas even more profound for Hunter\u201d and his daughter, Ashley. \u201cIt made me a little more fatalistic. It also caused me and Jill enormous pain because he should be the one sitting there talking to you, Beau. He was a better man than I am, and so is Hunter,\u201d Joe Biden said. Hunter, in his book, wrote that he and his father initially \u201cdealt with our grief in ways that often were incongruent with helping each other.\u201d His father immersed himself in his work, as vice president and then in the run-up to his 2020 campaign, but ultimately the attacks on him in that campaign helped bring them together again. \u201cWhenever I apologized to him for bringing so much heat onto his campaign, he responded by saying how sorry he was for putting me on the spot, for bringing so much heat onto me, especially at a time when I was so determined to get well,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest political debate my dad and I had for months: Who should apologize to whom?\u201d The wrecked car of Neilia Biden, 1972.

Last week, the Biden administration imposed a 60-day suspension of new oil and gas leasing and drilling permits on federal lands unless the Interior Department\u2019s leaders approved them. Biden went a step further Wednesday, by ordering a moratorium on new oil and gas leases on federal land and water areas. However, this is a far cry from the more dramatic step climate activists are calling for (and that the oil industry fears): a full-blown federal ban on fracking. \u201cLet me be clear, and I know this always comes up. We\u2019re not going to ban fracking,\u201d Biden told reporters Wednesday.

And it\u2019s not even clear that a president has the legal power to ban fracking on private lands \u2013 that would likely take an act of Congress. Rather, Biden\u2019s moratorium on oil and gas leases applies only to federal land, which accounts for less than a quarter of total US oil production and much less for natural gas. And the freeze does not impact existing leases. In other words, ExxonMobil and Chevron can continue to frack away. \u201cWe do not think Biden has the authority to ban fracking and if he did, he wouldn\u2019t go that far,\u201d said"}], "source": "rag_only"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 5, "concluded_by_rag": true, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.2}

The magazine has faced significant backlash, particularly from Muslim communities, for its portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad.\n\n2. **Key Points from the Knowledge**:\n   - Charlie Hebdo has a history of publishing content that many consider offensive, particularly towards Islam.\n   - The magazine's actions have sparked debates about freedom of expression versus respect for religious beliefs.\n   - The statement implies a broader narrative of hostility from Western institutions towards Islam, which is a subjective interpretation and not a universally accepted fact.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Claim**: The statement claims that the actions of Charlie Hebdo reveal a \"hatred and hostility\" from Western political and cultural institutions towards Islam. While it is true that the magazine's actions have been perceived as provocative and have led to significant controversy, the assertion that this reflects a systemic hostility from all Western institutions is a generalization that lacks nuance. Not all Western institutions or individuals share this sentiment, and many advocate for interfaith dialogue and respect for diverse beliefs.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The statement presents a subjective interpretation of the events surrounding Charlie Hebdo and their implications for Western attitudes towards Islam.

Ridofranz / Getty Images/iStockphoto Key Takeaways From Biden\u2019s Journey Joe Biden\u2019s life took him from humble courtrooms in Delaware all the way to the White House. We can\u2019t all hope to become president, but Biden\u2019s story is instructive. Here are a few lessons the average person can take away from it. Henglein and Steets / Getty Images Building Wealth Takes Time First, consider how long it took for Biden to become a millionaire. He began his career in 1968 and likely didn\u2019t reach\n2014, collecting an average of $250,000 per appearance \u2014 including before major corporations like Goldman Sachs. Sensitive to the complaints Clinton faced as she tried to keep some of her speeches private, the Biden campaign made a point of saying that more than half his speaking engagements were open to the media. According to Biden\u2019s financial reports, his speaking fees were as high as $234,820 in one case. When Biden gave a lecture at Drew University in New Jersey in March 2018, he was paid $190,000. A couple of weeks later, he was paid $180,000 to speak at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. A Biden campaign official said the large speaking fees from universities came from special funds not linked to school tuition. Still, large fees from schools could be an issue at a time Biden and other candidates have made the rapid rise in the cost of attending college a major campaign issue. Biden may have avoided some of the landmines that hurt Clinton. While the details provided on the financial disclosures are vague for some of his events, there do not appear to be any checks collected from Wall Street investment banks or other big corporate interests. Overall, the documents showed the Bidens reported income of $396,456 in 2016, more than $11 million in 2017 and $4.6 million in 2018. The couple paid federal income tax at a rate of 23.5% in 2016, 33.9% in 2017 and 33.4% in 2018. Their charitable donations rose with their income: In 2016, the Bidens gave 1.5% of their income to charity; in 2017, they gave 9.2%; and in 2018, they donated 6%. Sizeable chunks of their donations went to nonprofits named for the Bidens. Of the $1 million the Bidens donated to charity in 2017, $100,000 went to the Joseph Biden Foundation Community Legal Aid Society Inc., and $150,000 went to the Beau Biden Foundation for the Protection of Children, an organization named for Biden\u2019s son, who died of brain cancer in 2015. An additional $55,000 went to Biden-related charities in 2018. Also in 2018, the Bidens reported a $25,000 contribution to the International Assn. of Firefighters Foundation. The group found a way to thank him: When Biden launched his campaign earlier this year, the firefighters union was the first to endorse him.\nbegun feeling wealthy. The average U.S. wage was under $20,000 throughout the period. Joe earned over three times that for most of the decade, which doesn\u2019t account for Jill\u2019s income. The family had enough to contribute a significant amount to savings every year. Their net worth likely went up substantially during this period because of that. But although Joe earned a good salary, the Bidens probably still weren\u2019t millionaires at this point. \u00a9Shutterstock.com June 1987: Announces Candidacy for Presidency Joe Biden first revealed his ambitions for the White House in 1987 and announced his candidacy. He sought the Democratic nomination, but was unsuccessful, losing to Michael Dukakis. Biden was thought of as a \u201cbright new hope\u201d in the Democratic party. However, a video surfaced of him plagiarizing another politician without attribution. That may sound like a relatively minor scandal by today\u2019s standards. But it was a big deal in 1987. Soon after, reporters discovered that Biden graduated near the bottom of his law school class. He got a reputation for being a candidate with style but not substance, and he dropped out of the race. The future president also had a health scare this year. He had to have surgery to fix two brain aneurysms. In typical Biden fashion, he didn\u2019t allow the health scare to derail him from his goals.

He started the 1990s earning $98,400 and ended his time in the Senate earning $165,200 in 2007. During this period, Biden also taught at Widener University on the side, earning about $20,000 annually. His wife Jill taught English at Delaware Technical Community College, a role that paid her around $60,000 per year. All in all, the family was earning around $230,000 annually by the early 2000s. Some years they made more, such as in 2005, when they earned an additional $81,250 from a literary agency. Biden and his wife purchased their Delaware home during this era, too. The couple paid $350,000 for a four-acre lot in New Castle County, building a 6,850-square-foot home. We can\u2019t say for certain, but this is likely when the Biden family became net-worth millionaires. The property and completed home may have been worth close\n1972: Elected to U.S. Senate, Earns $42,500 Annually Biden\u2019s career in the federal government started with his election to the U.S. Senate in 1972. He earned $42,500 that first year. That may not sound like much, but it\u2019s over $300,000 in today\u2019s dollars. Tragically, Biden\u2019s joy at being elected to the Senate was short-lived. His wife and three children were in a car crash while Christmas shopping the month after he was elected. He lost his wife, Neilia, and daughter Naomi, but his sons Beau and Hunter recovered. The incident profoundly impacted Biden, which he\u2019s spoken openly about throughout his life. For instance, in 2020, he said , \u201cThere\u2019s a reason to grieve. You\u2019ve had great loss. But there will come a time \u2026 when you\u2019ll think of your [loved one] and you\u2019ll get a smile to your lips before you get a tear to your eye.\u201d Trending Now: How Much Is President Joe Biden Worth as He Seeks Reelection?

He also got a raise that year when U.S. senator salaries increased to $57,500. Story Continues From this point forward, the Biden household has two incomes. However, as a schoolteacher, Jill Biden likely didn\u2019t earn very much.

DEMOCRATIC presidential candidate Joe Biden in Los Angeles in May, with Mayor Eric Garcetti, left. (Robert Gauthier Los Angeles Times) PREVIOUS IMAGE Image NEXT IMAGE By Janet Hook and Evan Halper WASHINGTON \u2014 Joe Biden\u2019s income soared from less than $400,000 a year while he was vice president to more than $15 million in the two years after he left the Obama White House, a spike in wealth due to sales of his 2017 book and speaking fees that routinely ran more than $100,000 per event. Biden\u2019s campaign released a financial disclosure form and three years of income tax returns starting with 2016, his last year in office, and running through 2018. He had previously released his returns from earlier years. The documents showed that he made 47 paid speaking appearances from January 2018 through the end of May 2019, 30 of which were on a book tour, for fees totaling $4.29 million. Biden is the latest Democrat to release tax returns and other financial information as the party\u2019s candidates seek to draw a sharp contrast with President Trump, who has repeatedly refused to do so. Nonetheless, his sudden affluence could create some political liabilities for Biden, who is trying to make his blue-collar, middle-class roots central to his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. He also frequently mentions in campaign speeches that he was one of the least-wealthy members of the U.S. Senate during his 36 years there. Biden argues he is uniquely qualified to win over voters in working-class communities that have abandoned a Democratic Party they see as elitist and out of touch. Biden\u2019s appeal to such voters has played a big role in elevating him to front-runner in polling for the race. But since leaving the White House, Biden\u2019s lifestyle has hardly been middle-class. After signing a multimillion-dollar, three-book deal with Flatiron Books, Biden and his wife, Jill, purchased a six-bedroom vacation house in Rehoboth Beach, Del., for $2.7 million. The suburban Washington mansion he lives in is a sprawling home with a facade resembling the White House.

President Donald Trump's first line of the night, about COVID-19 deaths, was false and set the tone as he and Democratic rival Joe Biden unleashed a torrent of claims in their last presidential debate . Trump misrepresented the reality of the pandemic in myriad and familiar ways, insisting against obvious reality that the pandemic is drawing to a close. He also boasted about \"clean\" facilities at the border for migrant children, ignoring the filthy conditions under which they were held in 2018. Biden, at times, was selective on the coronavirus and other matters, at one point stating that no one under Obamacare lost private health coverage. Millions did.

According to data through Oct. 21 from Johns Hopkins University, the seven-day rolling average for daily new cases in the U.S. rose over the past two weeks from over 42,300 on Oct. 7 to nearly 60,000 on Oct. 21.

This election marked the first time since 1948 that the Democratic Party won the popular vote in four consecutive elections. Trump refused to accept the results; he and his allies made disproven claims of fraud, pressured elections officials, filed several unsuccessful lawsuits, [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] and directly attempted to overturn the results at the county, state, and federal level. This culminated in the attack on the United States Capitol , an attempted self-coup , on January 6, 2021, for which Trump was impeached a second time . The day after the attack, Trump stated that a \"new administration\" would be succeeding his, without mentioning president-elect Biden by name, in a video posted on Twitter .

The Maine Republican Party filed signatures for a veto referendum to preclude the use of RCV for the 2020 election, but Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap found there were insufficient valid signatures to qualify for the ballot.

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, the presumptive presidential nominees, shared a debate stage June 27 for the first time since 2020, in a feisty confrontation that \u2014 thanks to debate rules \u2014 managed to avoid the near-constant interruptions that marred their previous meetings. CNN hosted the debate , which had no audience, at its Atlanta studio. CNN anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash moderated. The debate format allowed CNN to mute candidates' microphones when it wasn't their turn to speak. READ MORE: 3 key moments from CNN's Biden-Trump debate Trump attacked Biden's record, blaming inflation and other issues on Biden's \"insane and stupid policies.\" Biden questioned Trump's conduct, noting that Trump is a convicted felon and saying he has the \"morals of an alley cat.\" Biden and Trump clashed on topics including immigration, the economy, abortion and their ages. Trump's outlandish immigration claim Trump says Biden \"allowed millions of people to come in here from prisons, jails and mental institutions.\" Pants on Fire! Immigration officials arrested about 103,700 noncitizens with criminal convictions (whether in the U.S. or abroad) from fiscal years 2021 to 2024, federal data shows. That accounts for people stopped at and between ports of entry. Not everyone was let in. The term \"noncitizens\" includes people who may have had legal immigration status in the U.S. but were not U.S. citizens. The data reflects the people that the federal government knows about, but it's inexhaustive. However, immigration experts said despite the data's limitations, there is no evidence to support Trump's statement. Biden's close to the mark about immigration reductions Biden: \"I've changed (the law) in the way that now you're in a situation where there are 40 percent fewer people coming across the border illegally.\" Mostly True. The Department of Homeland Security announced that illegal immigration encounters dropped by 40 percent, to fewer than 2,400 each day , in the weeks after Biden announced a policy largely barring\nwere fairly closely divided in their preferences: 44% said if they had voted, it would have been for Trump, while 40% said they would have voted for Harris. This stands in contrast to 2020, when eligible voters who didn\u2019t vote expressed a clear preference for Biden (46% said they would have voted for Biden, 35% said they would have voted for Trump). Turnout and the 2024 election Among all 2020 Trump voters, 89% voted in 2024, compared with 85% among Biden\u2019s 2020 voters. The turnout difference was larger among Hispanic voters than among many other groups: 86% of Trump\u2019s 2020 Hispanic voters turned out in 2024, compared with 77% of Biden\u2019s Hispanic voters. Trump also held turnout advantages among men and women, adults 35 and older, and those with no college degree. In contrast, there was almost no difference in 2024 turnout among 2020 Trump and Biden voters who are White. And among young voters who were eligible to vote in both elections (those ages 22 to 34 in 2024), there was a 3 percentage point difference in the rate at which Biden\u2019s 2020 voters turned out in 2024 (77%) compared with Trump\u2019s voters (80%). Composition of voters and nonvoters in 2024 Consistent with long-standing patterns in turnout, voters and nonvoters in 2024 differed substantially on several demographic characteristics. Compared with voters, nonvoters were younger, had lower family incomes, and were less likely to be White or to have attended college. Young adults were a larger share of nonvoters in 2024 than in 2020 (30% vs. 25%). Age has long been a reliable predictor of turnout. Citizens under age 30 constituted only 15% of all voters in 2024, considerably below their share of the age-eligible population (20%). Almost half of nonvoters (48%) had only a high school education or less, compared with 28% among voters. College graduates made up about twice the share of voters (41%) as nonvoters (22%). Non-Hispanic White adults made up a larger share of voters than nonvoters in 2024, though the share who were voters declined slightly from 73% in 2020 to 71% in 2024. White adults were also a smaller share of nonvoters in 2024 than in 2020, reflecting the steady growth of the non-White population in the U.S. In 2024, nonvoters were split in their preferences between Trump and Harris. They were also closely divided in their partisan affiliation.

It clarifies that ID2020 is not a project that can be canceled by the president, as it is an independent nonprofit organization. The claim that Trump \"canceled\" ID2020 is linked to misinformation and conspiracy theories surrounding Gates and his initiatives.\n\n3. **Authority to Cancel**: The knowledge points out that the president does not have the authority to cancel a nonprofit organization\u2019s project. The process of canceling or halting a project would typically involve the organization itself or relevant regulatory bodies, not the president directly.\n\n4. **Context of the Claim**: The claim appears to be part of a broader narrative that misrepresents Gates' initiatives and their implications, as noted in the knowledge. It suggests that the statement is rooted in conspiracy theories rather than factual events.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement that \"US President Trump canceled Bill Gates\u2019 project known as ID2020\" is not supported by the provided knowledge. \n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "control over their \u201cdigital IDs.\u201d For example, it has partnered with iRespond and the International Rescue Committee on a program to \u201coffer a digital identity platform\u201d to refugees at a camp in Thailand that would allow them \u201cto not only access improved healthcare services but also securely store educational and professional credentials.\u201d The organization was founded by several partners \u2014 including Microsoft, of which Gates is co-founder, and by Gavi , a Gates-backed organization that seeks to provide access to vaccines in impoverished countries. In recent months, ID2020 has been the subject of conspiracy theories. We\u2019ve previously written about a false claim that Gates has proposed tracking people with microchips. Some have evidently linked such baseless claims also to ID2020. As Snopes reports , those claims misrepresent ID2020\u2019s projects. The notion that a Gates project was \u201ccancelled\u201d may be a reference to an at-home testing initiative for the novel coronavirus, backed by Gates, that was taking place in the Seattle area. The Food and Drug Administration recently ordered the project to temporarily halt its effort until additional approvals were granted; but it hasn\u2019t been permanently canceled. That project \u2014 the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network \u2014 wrote on its website on May 14 that \u201c SCAN\u2019s test is authorized by the Washington State Department of Health.

Pursuant to that order, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was tasked with establishing an AI task force and developing a strategic plan, which they released at the beginning of January. President Biden\u2019s order, according to the Trump administration, \u201cestablished unnecessarily burdensome requirements for companies developing and deploying AI that would stifle private sector innovation and threaten American technological leadership.\u201d President Trump has named a new Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, and has called for the development of an AI action plan within 180 days. President Trump signed a new order titled \u201cRemoving Barriers to American AI Innovation,\u201d which claims the Biden-era order hindered innovation and placed \u201cunnecessary government control over the development of AI.\u201d It also states that \u201cAmerican development of AI systems must be free from ideological bias or engineered social agendas. President Trump has publicly announced support for the $500B \u201cStargate Initiative,\u201d which is meant to fuel AI adoption in healthcare, manufacturing, and defense through private funding. The leaders of the AI companies funding this initiative have highlighted AI\u2019s ability to transform health care, including using AI to rapidly develop new vaccines. While the new administration\u2019s support for innovation in AI is apparent, the direction for the regulation and oversight of AI in health care is murkier than ever before. 4. World Health Organization . President Trump issued an Order requiring the United States to leave the World Health Organization (WHO), which is consistent with his 2020 push for the United States\u2019 exit that former President Biden blocked shortly after he was inaugurated in 2021.

The bill outlines a $100 billion fund to be managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in order to fund contact tracing efforts across the country, as we\u2019ve previously explained . Secondly, the president doesn\u2019t have the power to \u201ccancel\u201d a bill. Instead, he could veto a piece of legislation if it were to come to his desk. But the bill in question is far from that step: H.R. 6666 is currently before a House committee.

The 48-year-old Barrett fills the seat previously held by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died on Sept. 18 of complications from pancreatic cancer. The 52-48 vote capped a meteoric rise for Barrett, who spent almost all of her career as a law professor who was well regarded but little known outside academic circles. And for conservatives, the vote represented the culmination of a decades-long effort to move the ideological balance on the court solidly to the right. In contrast to Ginsburg, who spent nearly three decades as one of the court\u2019s most reliably liberal votes, Barrett has said that her judicial philosophy is similar to that of the late conservative hero Justice Antonin Scalia, for whom Barrett served as a law clerk. Democrats decried the decision to confirm Barrett less than two weeks before the upcoming presidential election, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) warned that the \u201cAmerican people will suffer the consequences of Judge Barrett\u2019s far-right, out-of-the-mainstream views for generations.\u201d Barrett catapulted onto the national scene in 2017, during the confirmation hearings for her seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit. Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee suggested that Barrett, who is a devout Catholic, might allow her faith to influence her judging \u2013 an allegation that Barrett staunchly denied. And perhaps most notably, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California told Barrett that, based on Barrett\u2019s speeches, \u201cthe conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within you.\u201d Feinstein\u2019s rhetoric did not keep Barrett from being confirmed to the court of appeals, by a vote of 55 to 43, on Oct. 31, 2017. In fact, it may have had the opposite effect: Conservative Catholics adopted the phrase as a rallying cry, putting it on coffee mugs and t-shirts, and Barrett\u2019s name was one of five names added in November 2017 to President Donald Trump\u2019s list of potential nominees to the Supreme Court. When Justice Anthony Kennedy retired from the Supreme Court in June 2018, Barrett was allegedly among the finalists to fill the vacancy.

Chuck Schumer have an affair with a 16-year-old girl ? A: No. That claim was originally made up by a self-described satirical website, but has been circulating on right-wing social media accounts as though it happened. FULL ANSWER What started out as a joke has turned into ammunition for right-wing social media accounts to defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of committing sexual assault in the 1980s. The transformation from parody to recrimination took place over the course of almost a year. Here\u2019s how it happened: In December 2017, America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, a site that describes its content as satire aimed at provoking conservatives, posted a made-up story claiming that Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer had impregnated a 16-year-old girl. The hoax story was related to allegations at the time that Roy Moore , the Republican who lost a special Senate election in Alabama, had pursued sexual relationships with underage girls when he was in his 30s. The bogus Schumer story was then copied by other websites that presented it as if it were real and without a satire disclaimer. A conspiracy-theorist blogger and YouTube personality then took the story and embellished it in a post headlined: \u201c BREAKING: Chuck Schumer, Democrat Senate Minority Leader, Accused of Raping His Daughter\u2019s 16 Year Old Friend: Friend Then \u2018Committed Suicide\u2019 \u201d That post became the basis of a recent attack on Schumer by Lori Hendry , a popular Twitter personality who describes herself as an \u201cunapologetic conservative.\u201d Hendry, who has about 246,000 followers, shared the false story about Schumer in a tweet defending Kavanaugh. Dear Chuck Schumer you were accused of raping your daughter\u2019s 16-year-old friend who then committed suicide. u categorically denied guilt. Judge Kavanaugh is accused of a much lesser accusation and emphatically denying it too so why do you gounscathed and he is being crucified? \u2014 Lori Hendry (@Lrihendry) September 18, 2018 Hendry\u2019s tweet was retweeted 15,000 times and liked 23,000 times. It then migrated to Facebook, where it was shared thousands of times as a meme. But there are red flags that the story is not true. For example, it claims that Schumer\u2019s daughter, \u201cLisa Schumer,\u201d exposed her father\u2019s past relationship with her childhood\nRushing, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit \u2013 to fill the opening left by Ginsburg\u2019s death. But it\u2019s not clear that either woman was ever actually seriously in the running, as the president offered Barrett the job on Sept. 21 and nominated her on Sept. 26, in a ceremony at the White House that was notable for the dearth of masks and social distancing. At least 11 people who attended the ceremony later tested positive for COVID-19, including the president, two senators, and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. By the time Barrett\u2019s confirmation hearings began on Oct. 12, Democrats had few options to stop the nomination. Instead, they frequently argued that, if confirmed, Barrett would provide a key vote to strike down the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate and, with it, the rest of the law when the Supreme Court hears oral argument on Nov. 10 in a challenge to the mandate. Republican senators emphasized Barrett\u2019s qualifications for the job and her commitment to following the original meaning of the Constitution. Some senators, like Josh Hawley of Missouri, also condemned what they portrayed as attacks on Barrett\u2019s religion. When the Senate Judiciary Committee met on Oct. 22 to consider whether to send Barrett\u2019s nomination to the full Senate, Democratic senators were not there. Knowing they did not have the votes to stop the nomination from moving forward, several of them left photos of their constituents to fill their chairs \u2013 a move intended to symbolize the people who would be hurt if the ACA were struck down. Without any Democratic opposition, Barrett\u2019s nomination was voted out of committee unanimously. Going into Monday\u2019s final vote, there was little suspense about how the vote might turn out. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) had opposed moving forward with the confirmation process this close to the election, but she announced on Saturday that she would support Barrett\u2019s confirmation. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who had voted two years ago to confirm Kavanaugh, announced that she would vote against Barrett. No Democrats crossed party lines to vote for Barrett. In a ceremony at the White House shortly after the vote, Justice Clarence Thomas administered the constitutional oath, one of the two oaths that Barrett must take. The Supreme Court\u2019s Public Information Office announced on Monday night that Chief Justice John Roberts would administer the second oath, the judicial oath, on Tuesday in"}], "source": "rag_only"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 3, "concluded_by_rag": true, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.2}

Both candidates erred on Social Security, with Biden incorrectly saying that Trump \u201cwants to get rid\u201d of the program, and Trump falsely alleging that Biden will \u201cwipe out\u201d Social Security due to the influx of people at the border. Trump misleadingly claimed that he was \u201cthe one that got the insulin down for the seniors,\u201d not Biden. Costs were lowered for some under a limited project by the Trump administration. Biden signed a law capping costs for all seniors with Medicare drug coverage. Trump warned that Biden \u201cwants to raise your taxes by four times,\u201d but Biden has not proposed anything like that. Trump was also mostly wrong when he said Biden \u201cwants the Trump tax cuts to expire.\u201d Biden said he would extend them for anyone making under $400,000 a year. Biden repeated his misleading claim that billionaires pay an average federal tax rate of 8%. That White House calculation factors in earnings on unsold stock as income. Trump repeated his false claim that \u201ceverybody,\u201d including all legal scholars, wanted to end Roe v. Wade\u2019s constitutional right to abortion. Trump falsely claimed that \u201cthe only jobs\u201d Biden \u201ccreated are for illegal immigrants and bounced back jobs that bounced back from the COVID.\u201d Total nonfarm employment is higher than it was before the pandemic, as is the employment level of native-born workers. Biden claimed that Trump oversaw the \u201clargest deficit of any president,\u201d while Trump countered that \u201cwe now have the largest deficit\u201d under Biden. The largest budget deficit was under Trump in fiscal year 2020, but that was largely because of emergency spending due to COVID-19. Biden misleadingly said that \u201cBlack unemployment is the lowest level it has been in a long, long time.\u201d The rate reached a record low in April 2023, and it was low under Trump, too, until the pandemic. Biden said Trump called U.S. veterans killed in World War I \u201csuckers and losers,\u201d which Trump called a \u201cmade up quote.\u201d The Atlantic"}], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 2, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.2}
