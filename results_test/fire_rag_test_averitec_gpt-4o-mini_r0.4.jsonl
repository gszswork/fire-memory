There are three reasons, according to Greene, not to trust the White House's announcement that Trump tested positive: Trump was on his way to losing his reelection bid after his performance during the first presidential debate on Sept. 29. Testing positive for COVID-19 redirected attention away from the topic of white supremacists. By \"sailing through\" a fake illness, Trump could prove his mettle to supporters and emulate Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Greene doesn't trust \"anything that comes out of (Trump's) mouth, or his 'Twitter thumbs.'\" Greene did not mention first lady Melania Trump's positive test result in his post. \"My FB post on it was instantaneous and has received more, and quicker, response ... and more positive response ... than anything I believe I have ever posted,\" Greene told USA TODAY in an email. Greene attributed his skepticism to \"severe cynicism\" after untruths told by Trump during his presidency, as well as a \"Coronavirus October Surprise.\" Trump has made more than 20,000 false or misleading claims during his term, according to a July report by The Washington Post's Fact Checker. \"The term 'October Surprise' was coined by a 1980s political operative but has ever since been appropriated by the media to describe unexpected political disasters in the twilight hours of the campaign,\" the Smithsonian Magazine explained , adding \"they\u2019ve become a staple of modern politics.\" In Greene's view, an \"October surprise\" is one of \"12 Ways Donald Trump Can Win,\" a list compiled by Greene in an Aug. 23 Medium blog post .

Some of posts tapped into baseless conspiracy theories, and others shared outright falsehoods, as we\u2019ll explain. First, here\u2019s some of what we know about the matter: Trump announced early Oct. 2 on Twitter that he had tested positive for the virus, which causes COVID-19. \u201c Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER! \u201d he wrote shortly before 1 a.m. That announcement followed breaking news by Bloomberg News that a Trump aide, Hope Hicks, had tested positive for the virus. Hicks had been traveling with Trump in recent days. The White House later released a memo from Dr. Sean P. Conley, Trump\u2019s White House physician, dated Oct. 1, which in part said: \u201cThis evening I received confirmation that President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump have tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\u201d White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told reporters that the president was experiencing \u201cmild symptoms.\u201d A subsequent memo from Conley specified that Trump had \u201cPCR-confirmation\u201d \u2014 a reference to a standard testing method \u2014 and said Trump received a \u201csingle 8 gram dose of Regeneron\u2019s polyclonal antibody cocktail\u201d and other medicine. The \u201cPresident remains fatigued but in good spirits,\u201d Conley said, adding that Melania Trump \u201cremains well with only a mild cough and headache.\u201d Later in the day, the White House announced Trump would go to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center . Speculation, Conspiracy Theories Floated In the hours immediately following Trump\u2019s announcement, with few other details available, some turned to speculation. Others shared conspiracy theories. Among the posts to gain traction online were posts suggesting that the president was not actually sick, but using a fabricated diagnosis to benefit his reelection campaign. On the other side, some implied without substantiation that \u201cthe left\u201d may have deliberately spread the virus to him. Neither notion is supported by available evidence.

But President Donald Trump falsely claimed \u201c99%\u201d of cases \u201care totally harmless.\u201d The president, according to his press secretary, was referring to the case fatality rate, and he claimed the amount of testing the U.S. has conducted showed this. The testing actually shows a case fatality rate of 4.5% , but not everyone who has contracted COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, has been tested. Some estimates say the fatality rate among those infected is likely around 1%. Asked whether cases that don\u2019t result in death are \u201charmless,\u201d White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said : \u201cThe president was noting the fact that the vast majority of Americans who contract coronavirus will come out on the other side of this.\u201d \u201cSome estimates do place the mortality at about 1%,\u201d Columbia University epidemiologist Stephen Morse told us in an email, noting that we don\u2019t have a solid figure for the total number of people who have been infected. \u201cHowever, 1% mortality is not the same as \u201899% \u2026 totally harmless\u2019. I wish that were true. \u2018Totally harmless\u2019 suggests that the infection doesn\u2019t do any harm.\u201d In addition to patients who get sick enough to need hospitalization, some who have recovered from COVID-19 report experiencing long-term effects, \u201cincluding lung damage but also other symptoms, and we don\u2019t know how common these sequelae (the term for aftereffects of disease) are,\u201d Morse said. Trump made his claim in July 4 remarks at the White House. \u201cLikewise, testing \u2014 there were no tests for a new virus, but now we have tested almost 40 million people,\u201d he said . \u201cBy so doing, we show cases, 99% of which are totally harmless.

The COVID Tracking Project had the total at 34.9 million as of July 4.

Greene theorized Trump would persuade the Food and Drug Administration to approve a vaccine that \"cures\" COVID-19 this month, effectively ending \"The Coronavirus Crisis.\" \"This could be another version of that 'October Surprise' strategy,\" Greene said. USA TODAY reached out to the Trump campaign for comment. Trump adviser Hope Hicks, others tested positive for COVID-19 Despite skepticism by some on social media, the president could have been exposed to the coronavirus during any number of events over the past few weeks. News of the president and first lady's positive test results came after reports that White House adviser Hope Hicks tested positive, according to USA TODAY . Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity on Thursday that he and the first lady \"spend a lot of time with Hope.\" Hicks traveled extensively with Trump over the last week, including to the first 2020 presidential debate in Cleveland on Sept. 29. USA TODAY reported in-person attendees on Trump's side of the auditorium refused to wear masks. Debate moderator said a safety personnel member from the Cleveland Clinic offered masks to Trump's family, but he was \"waved away,\" according to USA TODAY . Hicks was one of 180 attendees to watch Trump announce the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court in the White House Rose Garden last week. USA TODAY reported that fewer than a third of those at the announcement wore masks. During an interview on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" on Friday, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who helped Trump prepare for the debate, said the president and others in the room were not wearing masks during preparations. \"No one was wearing masks in the room when we were prepping the president during that period of time. And the group was about five or six people, in total,\" Christie said, according to USA TODAY . Wearing a mask as well as social distancing from others by at least 6 feet are recommended steps for preventing the spread of COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition to Hicks , a number of other people around the president or who were at\nacting chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers Tomas Philipson had a mild case of COVID-19 in June but has since left his position at the White House. Top spokesperson for Vice President Mike Pence, Katie Miller, tested positive in early May. Miller returned to work. Pence confirmed he and wife Karen tested negative for the virus Friday morning, according to USA TODAY . Other members of the White House staff who work close to the president and family also tested positive in recent months. The list includes cafeteria workers, a White House valet, a Marine One helicopter pilot and a staffer for Pence, USA TODAY reported. Trump imitating Bolsonaro? On Friday, Greene retweeted a Financial Times video about how President Bolsonaro benefitted from his COVID-19 diagnosis. USA TODAY reported the Brazilian leader tested positive in July. \"The former army captain has repeatedly downplayed the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, often joined in rallies without wearing a mask\" the video says. \"Following in the footsteps of his political soulmate U.S. President Donald Trump, Bolsonaro also said he was taking the anti-Malaria drug hydroxychloroquine.\" Trump once touted hydroxychloroquine as a preventative drug for COVID-19, despite evidence showing it does not prevent the development of the disease, USA TODAY reported . Critics said Bolsonaro denied science by pitching the controversial drug as a possible solution. But returning to work after his quick recovery from COVID-19 made him seem like a \"messiah,\" according to the video. \"Assuming he truly recovered from the virus, he may emerge politically stronger from the pandemic,\" said Financial Times Brazil correspondent Andres Schipani. \"His approval ratings remain at roughly 30%, and they're already showing signs of improvement. With these numbers, history suggests he would be able to fend off efforts to eject him from office by impeachment procedures.\" Trump infamously said testing for the coronavirus is a double-edged sword and blamed a high number of U.S. cases on increased testing, according to USA TODAY . There are obvious similarities between Trump's and Bolsonaro's responses to the COVID-19 epidemic. But there is no proof that Trump planned to contract the disease or is lying about testing positive. Greene told USA TODAY the president's test result could be accurate, considering the number of people he is exposed to, but added \"It is doubtful we will EVER know.\" \"How can we trust ANYONE in Trump's loyal orbit(?)

In the context of the U.S., this would imply periods where the military has directly governed or had significant control over civilian governance.\n\n2. **Historical Context**: The United States has experienced military involvement in governance, but it has not been under military rule in the traditional sense for extended periods. The most notable instances of military governance in U.S. history include:\n   - The Reconstruction era (1865-1877) when federal troops were deployed in the South to enforce civil rights and maintain order.\n   - Martial law declarations during certain crises, such as the Civil War and World War II, but these were temporary and not indicative of a sustained military rule.\n\n3. **Cumulative Time Under Military Rule**: The claim states that the U.S. has been under military rule for 29 out of 60 years. This would imply that nearly half of the nation's history has been characterized by military governance. However, historical records do not support this assertion. The U.S. has primarily functioned as a civilian-led government with military oversight during specific conflicts or emergencies, rather than a continuous military rule.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the historical context and definitions of military rule, the statement appears to be exaggerated or misleading.

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly exaggerated the \"depleted\" state of the military when he took office. Dan Evon Published Sept. 26, 2020 Image courtesy of Getty Images/Stock photo Claim: U.S. President Donald Trump inherited a \"depleted\" military from President Obama. Rating: Mostly False About this rating What's True The U.S. national defense budget was slightly reduced during Obama's second term, in large part due to efforts by Congress to limit government spending and the withdrawal of troops from the Middle East. What's False However, the military wasn't \"depleted\" under Obama. The military never ran out of ammunition or went \"years\" without funding, as Trump claimed. The budget for national defense during Obama's term of office totaled nearly $6 trillion. One claim that has often been repeated by U.S. President Donald Trump is that he rebuilt a military that was \"totally depleted\" by his predecessor, Barack Obama. Trump's grievance is based on a grain of truth \u2014 military spending was reduced during Obama's second term \u2014 but Trump's statements on the matter have combined distorted facts with outright falsehoods. What Trump Has Said The way Trump tells it, the United States military was in a complete shambles when he took office. Over the years, Trump has made a variety of statements in order to perpetuate this notion. In one oft-repeated story, Trump illustrated his claim that Obama depleted the military by saying that the armed forces had \"no ammunition\" when he took office. In October 2019, for instance, Trump said : \"When I took over our military, we did not have ammunition.\" This is not true . The military did not run out of ammunition during the Obama administration (or during any other administration, as far as we can tell). In addition, Trump falsely claimed in August 2018, as he was signing the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2019, that the military had not received any money for years and years. Trump said: \"We\u2019ve been trying to get money. They never gave us money for the military for years and years. And\nspending has helped make troops and equipment more ready for combat, O\u2019Hanlon said. But overall, Trump\u2019s claim of a total rebuild is \"hyperbole.\" \"Most weapons are the same as before,\" O\u2019Hanlon said. \"There is more continuity than change in defense policy from Obama to Trump.\" According to an index of the military\u2019s strength by the conservative Heritage Foundation, the military currently receives a grade of \"marginal.\" \"The active component of the U.S. military is two-thirds the size it should be, operates equipment that is older than should be the case, and is burdened by readiness levels that are problematic,\" the report concluded . \"The current U.S. military force is likely capable of meeting the demands of a single major regional conflict while also attending to various presence and engagement activities,\" it said. \"It would be very hard-pressed to do more.\" Our ruling Trump said, \"The American military has been completely rebuilt under my administration at a cost of $2.5 trillion.\" The military is far from \"completely rebuilt.\" The Trump administration has made some strides in improving the military\u2019s operational readiness, but most weapons and infrastructure are the same as they were before Trump took office. The element of truth is in Trump\u2019s $2.5 trillion number, which comes from the total defense budgets for the last four fiscal years. Still, not all of that money has been spent, and not all of it has gone toward what would be considered a rebuild under any reasonable definition of the phrase. We rate this statement Mostly False.

If you did not return your mail-in or absentee ballot and you want to vote in person, you have two options: Bring your ballot and the pre-addressed outer return envelope to your polling place to be voided. After you surrender your ballot and envelope and sign a declaration, you can then vote a regular ballot.

Conclusion: In healthy anesthesiologists, wearing SMs for more than 2 h can significantly decrease SpO 2 and increase respiratory rates without affecting heart rates. Introduction Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally and attracted worldwide attention ( 1 ). On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic ( 2 ). It is essential to protect healthcare workers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical institutions require medical staff to wear personal protective equipment during diagnosis and treatment ( 3 ). However, frequent use of personal protective equipment, especially protective masks, can lead to various health-related problems, including headache, hypoxia, and skin damage ( 4 , 5 ). In daily work, anesthesiologists face long exposures to infected bodily fluids and blood, toxic surgical smoke, bacteria, and viruses in patients' respiratory tract and the possibility of needle stab injuries, resulting in anxiety and fear ( 6 \u2013 8 ). As part of the main staff in the operating room, anesthesiologists must follow the recognized infection control measures for the operating room, including the use of surgical masks (SMs). Although there is still substantial controversy ( 9 , 10 ), it is generally believed that wearing SMs can protect patients from bacteria in the mouth and nose of operating room staff and protect medical staff from contaminated blood, bodily fluids, and most of the operation smoke ( 11 ). At present, there is a serious shortage of anesthesiologists in China. The number of sudden deaths of anesthesiologists in China has increased sharply in recent years, and most of them die due to heavy workloads ( 12 ). From 11 November 2008 to 27 January 2018, 104 deaths due to overwork were reported among Chinese doctors, and anesthesiologists accounted for 20.19% of these cases ( 13 ). Increasing work pressure often leads to excessive fatigue and physical discomfort in anesthesiologists and threatens the safety of patients ( 14 , 15 ). Chinese anesthesiologists need to wear SMs to work for long periods of time every day, which may increase physical and mental fatigue. Research shows that wearing masks can significantly increase the temperature and humidity of the face, resulting in a decline\nFrontiers | Prolonged mask wearing changed nasal microbial characterization of young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic in Shanghai, China Your new experience awaits.

However, the impact of prolonged face mask wearing on nasal microbiota of healthy people is not fully understood. Methods: In this study, we compared the nasal microbiota of 82 young adults who wore face masks for an extended period of time to 172 mask-free peers from the same school recruited before the COVID-19 pandemic via 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Diversity, composition, and function of nasal microbiota between the two groups were analyzed. Prevalence of commensal bacteria colonized in the nasal cavity was determined by culture-based analysis. Results: We observed that prolonged face mask wearers had significantly different nasal microbial characterization and metabolic function compared to mask-free controls from 2018. Specifically, the nasal microbiota of the prolonged mask wearers displayed increased abundance of Staphylococcus , Pseudoalteromonas , Corynebacterium , etc. Meanwhile, the abundance of several genera including Bacteroides , Faecalibacterium , and Agathobacter was decreased. Moreover, we observed that COVID-19 infection history did not affect the composition of nasal microbiota significantly. Additionally, the culture-based analysis revealed that Staphylococcus aureus and Corynebacterium accolens increased, and Staphylococcus epidermidis decreased in the nasal cavity of prolonged mask wearers. Conclusions: Overall, our study suggests that prolonged face mask wearing can significantly alter the nasal microbiota. Introduction The nasal microbiota plays a crucial role in the maintenance of respiratory health, and disturbance in its composition and structure may lead to various respiratory disorders ( 1 ).

The pandemic this year has raised concerns about large groups of voters gathering indoors, so some additional states \u2014 California, Nevada, New Jersey, Vermont plus Washington, D.C. \u2014 have decided to send ballots to all active voters. In other states, voters have to take action to request a mail ballot, though some of them took that step already if they live in a state that allows a permanent absentee voting list that may be offered to all voters, or only to certain voters based on specific criteria such as age or disability. We asked the Trump campaign to show how it arrived at 80 million unsolicited ballots, and whether that included a handful of states that have generally held all vote-by-mail elections for years. We did not receive a response. It\u2019s possible that Trump or an aide saw a prediction in an August New York Times article that \"80 million mail ballots will flood election offices this fall.\" However, that figure isn\u2019t limited to voters who will be sent \"unsolicited\" ballots. It includes voters who will have to request a mail ballot. The New York Times found that ballots will be mailed directly to about 44 million voters in nine states and D.C. So that\u2019s a little more than half of the figure Trump cited. WRAL partners with PolitiFact NC to fact check political stories University of Florida political scientist Michael McDonald found a similar total number of ballots \u2014 44.4 million \u2014 that will be sent in states conducting all-mail elections. He also counted Montana, where Gov. Steve Bullock used his emergency powers to allow counties to opt in to holding an all-mail election. As of late August, most Montana counties opted for all mail. Paul Gronke, an expert on voting by mail at Reed College, predicted somewhere north of 80 million ballots will be cast by mail, double 2016\u2019s total. In D.C. and the states that decided to send ballots to all voters this year due to the pandemic, many of those voters would have likely requested a ballot anyway or were on permanent absentee-ballot lists. For example, in California in 2016, there were 13 million ballots cast, including 7 million absentee. Gronke added up how many ballots were cast by absentee during the 2016 elections in California, Nevada, New Jersey and Vermont and concluded at most, 7.5 million\n80 million \u201cunsolicited\u201d mail-in ballots will not be sent to voters ahead of the 2020 presidential election.\nballots \u2014 more than 1.3% of the total \u2014 were rejected in the state's March primary for a variety of reasons, including missed deadlines. The lawsuit argues that mail-in ballots should have to be only postmarked \u2014 not received \u2014 by 7 p.m. on Election Day. Kirk Nielsen, one of 10 plaintiffs in the case, says the fate of a ballot is out of a voter's hands once it goes in the mail. His was one of thousands of ballots rejected in the state in 2018. Nielsen says he mailed it eight days before Election Day, but it was not received until eight days after. He worries about being disenfranchised again. 2020 Election: Secure Your Vote This November, Election Night Could Stretch Into Election Week Or Month \"I want to vote by mail this year because of the pandemic. I don't want to get sick at a crowded polling place and I don't want to contribute to spreading the virus by going to a crowded polling place, but that said, I think there's an even greater risk this year voting by mail that my mail ballot might not be counted, along with thousands of others,\" Nielsen says. His case is scheduled to be heard this month, but Republicans were heartened by the judge's refusal to issue a preliminary injunction against the state's mail-in rules. The judge said the Election Day receipt deadline \"eliminates the problem of missing, unclear, or even altered postmarks, eliminates delay that can have adverse consequences, and eliminates the remote possibility that in an extremely close election \u2014 Florida has had some \u2014 a person who did not vote on or before Election Day can fill out and submit a ballot later.\" These are all arguments that Republicans have made in defense of keeping the Election Day deadline currently in place in most states. 2020 Election: Secure Your Vote Chaos In Primary Elections Raises Fears For November \"Allowing massive amounts of ballots to arrive or the counting to continue well after Election Day really allows room for fraud,\" says Mandi Merritt, national press secretary for the Republican National Committee. \"It allows losing candidates or other partisan operatives to go find more late votes that could potentially change the legitimate outcome of an election and really just leaves room for unnecessary litigation.\" While Merritt did not offer an example, she says even the possibility of fraud would undermine\nanyway or were on permanent absentee-ballot lists. For example, in California in 2016, there were 13 million ballots cast, including 7 million absentee. Gronke added up how many ballots were cast by absentee during the 2016 elections in California, Nevada, New Jersey and Vermont and concluded at most, 7.5 million or so ballots will be sent in those states to voters who have not requested them. In the state that is holding the largest all-mail election \u2014 California \u2014 about two-thirds of the voters had registered to vote absentee even before the move to mail every voter a ballot, said Nate Persily, a Stanford law professor. Trump\u2019s use of the term \"unsolicited\" While Trump uses the terms \"unsolicited\" or \"unrequested\" ballots, states generally use other terms such as \"voting by mail.\" Some experts were critical of Trump\u2019s terms, noting that if residents don\u2019t want to receive a ballot, they don\u2019t have to register in the states that automatically send them. \"In an all-mail ballot state, voter registration is a mail-ballot request,\" McDonald said. MIT professor Charles Stewart said he personally wouldn\u2019t use the word \"unsolicited\" but thinks it\u2019s fair game in political discourse. \"As to \u2018unsolicited,\u2019 I think that\u2019s a fair, if loaded, term,\" he said. \"You don\u2019t have to ask for a ballot, and there are voters in those states who would prefer not to be mailed one.\" Trump\u2019s misleading comments about ballot harvesting Trump criticized the effort to send ballots unrequested, and said that voters who receive them are \"going to harvest.\" Ballot harvesting generally refers to someone collecting absentee ballots on behalf of others and then submitting them. Some voting rights experts see the unofficial term \"ballot harvesting\" as pejorative and prefer the term \"ballot collection.\" Many states allow at least certain individuals to collect some ballots on behalf of others, which can be helpful for voters with disabilities or those without cars. Our ethics policy for PolitiFact journalists There have been isolated cases of fraud associated with ballot harvesting, including in a North Carolina congressional race in 2018. But Trump is wrong to suggest that such fraud is rampant. Trump has repeatedly suggested that the increase in voting by mail will lead to fraud. But fraud is statistically rare, including in states that have relied on voting by mail for years.

Also in 2017, news reports surfaced that Hunter Biden was in a romantic relationship with Hallie Olivere Biden, Beau Biden\u2019s widow. Their relationship would end two years later. During this time Beau went through multiple periods of alcohol and drug binges followed by rehab efforts.

Legal troubles and pardon In 2020 Hunter Biden disclosed that the Justice Department has been investigating him since late 2018. The investigation was led by David C.

In June 2023 Hunter Biden agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor counts of failing to pay his 2016 and 2017 taxes on time. He also accepted conditions that would avoid his being prosecuted on a felony charge that he lied when he said he was sober when buying a handgun in 2018. But the plea deal collapsed when the judge in the case refused to be what she called \u201ca rubber stamp\u201d on the agreement that some said reflected preferential treatment of the first son. In August 2023 U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland announced that Weiss had been named the special counsel in charge of the investigation, and prosecutors filed court documents saying that they expected the Biden case to go to trial. In June 2024 Biden went on trial for the gun-related charges, and he was found guilty on all three counts later that month. He thus became the first child of a sitting U.S. president to be convicted of a crime. In September 2024 Biden pleaded guilty to three felony counts and six misdemeanors in his federal tax case.

Some of posts tapped into baseless conspiracy theories, and others shared outright falsehoods, as we\u2019ll explain. First, here\u2019s some of what we know about the matter: Trump announced early Oct. 2 on Twitter that he had tested positive for the virus, which causes COVID-19. \u201c Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER! \u201d he wrote shortly before 1 a.m. That announcement followed breaking news by Bloomberg News that a Trump aide, Hope Hicks, had tested positive for the virus. Hicks had been traveling with Trump in recent days. The White House later released a memo from Dr. Sean P. Conley, Trump\u2019s White House physician, dated Oct. 1, which in part said: \u201cThis evening I received confirmation that President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump have tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\u201d White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told reporters that the president was experiencing \u201cmild symptoms.\u201d A subsequent memo from Conley specified that Trump had \u201cPCR-confirmation\u201d \u2014 a reference to a standard testing method \u2014 and said Trump received a \u201csingle 8 gram dose of Regeneron\u2019s polyclonal antibody cocktail\u201d and other medicine. The \u201cPresident remains fatigued but in good spirits,\u201d Conley said, adding that Melania Trump \u201cremains well with only a mild cough and headache.\u201d Later in the day, the White House announced Trump would go to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center . Speculation, Conspiracy Theories Floated In the hours immediately following Trump\u2019s announcement, with few other details available, some turned to speculation. Others shared conspiracy theories. Among the posts to gain traction online were posts suggesting that the president was not actually sick, but using a fabricated diagnosis to benefit his reelection campaign. On the other side, some implied without substantiation that \u201cthe left\u201d may have deliberately spread the virus to him. Neither notion is supported by available evidence. One popular Facebook post cast doubt on the diagnosis by saying that Trump \u201c needed a \u2018reset'\u201d for his campaign and therefore the diagnosis may\nacting chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers Tomas Philipson had a mild case of COVID-19 in June but has since left his position at the White House. Top spokesperson for Vice President Mike Pence, Katie Miller, tested positive in early May. Miller returned to work. Pence confirmed he and wife Karen tested negative for the virus Friday morning, according to USA TODAY . Other members of the White House staff who work close to the president and family also tested positive in recent months. The list includes cafeteria workers, a White House valet, a Marine One helicopter pilot and a staffer for Pence, USA TODAY reported. Trump imitating Bolsonaro? On Friday, Greene retweeted a Financial Times video about how President Bolsonaro benefitted from his COVID-19 diagnosis. USA TODAY reported the Brazilian leader tested positive in July. \"The former army captain has repeatedly downplayed the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, often joined in rallies without wearing a mask\" the video says. \"Following in the footsteps of his political soulmate U.S. President Donald Trump, Bolsonaro also said he was taking the anti-Malaria drug hydroxychloroquine.\" Trump once touted hydroxychloroquine as a preventative drug for COVID-19, despite evidence showing it does not prevent the development of the disease, USA TODAY reported . Critics said Bolsonaro denied science by pitching the controversial drug as a possible solution. But returning to work after his quick recovery from COVID-19 made him seem like a \"messiah,\" according to the video. \"Assuming he truly recovered from the virus, he may emerge politically stronger from the pandemic,\" said Financial Times Brazil correspondent Andres Schipani. \"His approval ratings remain at roughly 30%, and they're already showing signs of improvement. With these numbers, history suggests he would be able to fend off efforts to eject him from office by impeachment procedures.\" Trump infamously said testing for the coronavirus is a double-edged sword and blamed a high number of U.S. cases on increased testing, according to USA TODAY . There are obvious similarities between Trump's and Bolsonaro's responses to the COVID-19 epidemic. But there is no proof that Trump planned to contract the disease or is lying about testing positive. Greene told USA TODAY the president's test result could be accurate, considering the number of people he is exposed to, but added \"It is doubtful we will EVER know.\" \"How can we trust ANYONE in Trump's loyal orbit(?) Remember when\ncampaign,\" the Smithsonian Magazine explained , adding \"they\u2019ve become a staple of modern politics.\" In Greene's view, an \"October surprise\" is one of \"12 Ways Donald Trump Can Win,\" a list compiled by Greene in an Aug. 23 Medium blog post . Greene theorized Trump would persuade the Food and Drug Administration to approve a vaccine that \"cures\" COVID-19 this month, effectively ending \"The Coronavirus Crisis.\" \"This could be another version of that 'October Surprise' strategy,\" Greene said. USA TODAY reached out to the Trump campaign for comment. Trump adviser Hope Hicks, others tested positive for COVID-19 Despite skepticism by some on social media, the president could have been exposed to the coronavirus during any number of events over the past few weeks. News of the president and first lady's positive test results came after reports that White House adviser Hope Hicks tested positive, according to USA TODAY . Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity on Thursday that he and the first lady \"spend a lot of time with Hope.\" Hicks traveled extensively with Trump over the last week, including to the first 2020 presidential debate in Cleveland on Sept. 29. USA TODAY reported in-person attendees on Trump's side of the auditorium refused to wear masks. Debate moderator said a safety personnel member from the Cleveland Clinic offered masks to Trump's family, but he was \"waved away,\" according to USA TODAY . Hicks was one of 180 attendees to watch Trump announce the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court in the White House Rose Garden last week. USA TODAY reported that fewer than a third of those at the announcement wore masks. During an interview on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" on Friday, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who helped Trump prepare for the debate, said the president and others in the room were not wearing masks during preparations. \"No one was wearing masks in the room when we were prepping the president during that period of time. And the group was about five or six people, in total,\" Christie said, according to USA TODAY . Wearing a mask as well as social distancing from others by at least 6 feet are recommended steps for preventing the spread of COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition to Hicks , a number of other people around the president or who were at\nplace.

While there was initial confusion over coronavirus when Chinese authorities described it as an unusual form of pneumonia, the world has been well aware of the dimensions of the virus since January, when China acknowledged the severity of the condition and released the genetic information of Covid-19.

Harlan Oct 22, 1971 68-26 No. 450 C Dec\nfive names added in November 2017 to President Donald Trump\u2019s list of potential nominees to the Supreme Court. When Justice Anthony Kennedy retired from the Supreme Court in June 2018, Barrett was allegedly among the finalists to fill the vacancy. The job would go to Justice Brett Kavanaugh, but Trump reportedly told his advisers that he was \u201csaving\u201d Barrett in case Ginsburg were to leave the court during his presidency. Barrett\u2019s nomination and confirmation process played out against the backdrop of President Barack Obama\u2019s March 2016 nomination of Merrick Garland, the highly respected chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to fill the vacancy created by Scalia\u2019s 2016 death. Senate Republicans refused to hold a hearing for Garland, then 63 years old and generally regarded as a more centrist nominee. They maintained that it was too close to the upcoming presidential election, and that the next president, rather than Obama, should choose the new nominee. The seat remained open until April 2017, when Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump\u2019s first Supreme Court nominee, was confirmed. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) paved the way for Barrett\u2019s 2020 nomination last year. When asked at a May 2019 luncheon in Kentucky whether he would fill a vacancy if a Supreme Court justice were to leave the court in 2020, McConnell responded that he would. The difference between such an opening and the situation in 2016, McConnell explained, was that the White House and the Senate in 2016 were controlled by different political parties, while Republicans now hold both the Senate and the White House. But although Ginsburg had announced in December 2018 that she had been treated for lung cancer (the third of what would eventually prove to be five cancer diagnoses), the vacancy was at the time purely a hypothetical one. The hypothetical became real after Ginsburg\u2019s death in September, and McConnell pledged to fill the vacancy quickly. The president was reportedly considering Barrett and two other women \u2013 Judge Barbara Lagoa, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, and Judge Allison Jones Rushing, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit \u2013 to fill the opening left by Ginsburg\u2019s death. But it\u2019s not clear that either woman was ever actually seriously in the running, as the president offered Barrett the job on Sept. 21 and nominated her on Sept. 26,\nwas nominated by Republican president Benjamin Harrison on July 19, 1892. Shiras was confirmed as a Supreme Court justice seven days later, by the Republican controlled Senate on July 26, 1892.

Among the high-profile potential nominees from the list were Amy Coney Barrett , Britt Grant , Amul Thapar and David Stras , who were all elevated to the courts of appeals by President Trump.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] By September 21, Trump said that his list had been narrowed to just five names, with a final nomination to be made on September 24 or 25. [ 19 ] As of September 2020, President Trump's complete list of Supreme Court candidates contained 44 names, of whom 12 were women.

This context is important because it implies that Barrett may not support expansive interpretations of laws like the ACA.\n\n3. **Democratic Concerns**: The knowledge points out that Democrats frequently argued during her confirmation hearings that Barrett would provide a key vote to strike down the ACA\u2019s individual mandate. This indicates that there is a significant concern about her stance on the ACA, but it does not provide direct evidence of her written opinions or rulings specifically disagreeing with the ACA.\n\n4. **Lack of Specific Written Opinions**: The knowledge does not mention any specific written opinions or legal articles authored by Barrett that explicitly disagree with the ACA.

But it\u2019s not clear that either woman was ever actually seriously in the running, as the president offered Barrett the job on Sept. 21 and nominated her on Sept. 26, in a ceremony at the White House that was notable for the dearth of masks and social distancing. At least 11 people who attended the ceremony later tested positive for COVID-19, including the president, two senators, and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. By the time Barrett\u2019s confirmation hearings began on Oct. 12, Democrats had few options to stop the nomination. Instead, they frequently argued that, if confirmed, Barrett would provide a key vote to strike down the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate and, with it, the rest of the law when the Supreme Court hears oral argument on Nov. 10 in a challenge to the mandate. Republican senators emphasized Barrett\u2019s qualifications for the job and her commitment to following the original meaning of the Constitution. Some senators, like Josh Hawley of Missouri, also condemned what they portrayed as attacks on Barrett\u2019s religion. When the Senate Judiciary Committee met on Oct. 22 to consider whether to send Barrett\u2019s nomination to the full Senate, Democratic senators were not there. Knowing they did not have the votes to stop the nomination from moving forward, several of them left photos of their constituents to fill their chairs \u2013 a move intended to symbolize the people who would be hurt if the ACA were struck down. Without any Democratic opposition, Barrett\u2019s nomination was voted out of committee unanimously. Going into Monday\u2019s final vote, there was little suspense about how the vote might turn out. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) had opposed moving forward with the confirmation process this close to the election, but she announced on Saturday that she would support Barrett\u2019s confirmation. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who had voted two years ago to confirm Kavanaugh, announced that she would vote against Barrett. No Democrats crossed party lines to vote for Barrett. In a ceremony at the White House shortly after the vote, Justice Clarence Thomas administered the constitutional oath, one of the two oaths that Barrett must take. The Supreme Court\u2019s Public Information Office announced on Monday night that Chief Justice John Roberts would administer the second oath, the judicial oath, on Tuesday in\nBarrett confirmed as 115th justice - SCOTUSblog Skip to content Barrett confirmed as 115th justice By Amy Howe on Oct 27, 2020 The Senate on Monday night confirmed Judge Amy Coney Barrett as the 115th justice of the U.S. Supreme Court and the fifth woman to serve on the court. The 48-year-old Barrett fills the seat previously held by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died on Sept. 18 of complications from pancreatic cancer. The 52-48 vote capped a meteoric rise for Barrett, who spent almost all of her career as a law professor who was well regarded but little known outside academic circles. And for conservatives, the vote represented the culmination of a decades-long effort to move the ideological balance on the court solidly to the right. In contrast to Ginsburg, who spent nearly three decades as one of the court\u2019s most reliably liberal votes, Barrett has said that her judicial philosophy is similar to that of the late conservative hero Justice Antonin Scalia, for whom Barrett served as a law clerk. Democrats decried the decision to confirm Barrett less than two weeks before the upcoming presidential election, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) warned that the \u201cAmerican people will suffer the consequences of Judge Barrett\u2019s far-right, out-of-the-mainstream views for generations.\u201d Barrett catapulted onto the national scene in 2017, during the confirmation hearings for her seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit. Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee suggested that Barrett, who is a devout Catholic, might allow her faith to influence her judging \u2013 an allegation that Barrett staunchly denied. And perhaps most notably, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California told Barrett that, based on Barrett\u2019s speeches, \u201cthe conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within you.\u201d Feinstein\u2019s rhetoric did not keep Barrett from being confirmed to the court of appeals, by a vote of 55 to 43, on Oct. 31, 2017. In fact, it may have had the opposite effect: Conservative Catholics adopted the phrase as a rallying cry, putting it on coffee mugs and t-shirts, and Barrett\u2019s name was one of five names added in November 2017 to President Donald Trump\u2019s list of potential nominees to the Supreme Court. When Justice Anthony Kennedy retired from the Supreme Court in June 2018, Barrett was allegedly among the finalists to fill the vacancy.

Featured Weekly Ad\nthe advancement of Barrett's nomination so close to Election Day, after the Republican-led Senate in 2016 refused to hold hearings for then-President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, nearly eight months before that year's election. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., labeled the nomination process a \"cynical power grab.\" \"Nearly every Republican in this chamber led by the majority leader four years ago refused to even consider the Supreme Court nomination of a Democratic president on the grounds ... that we should wait until after the presidential election because the American people deserved a voice in the selection of their next justice,\" he said on Sunday. \"My colleagues, there is no escaping this glaring hypocrisy. As I said before, no tit-for-tat convoluted, distorted version of history will wipe away the stain that will exist forever with this Republican majority and with this Republican leader.\" Barrett's nomination cleared a procedural hurdle Sunday afternoon when the Senate voted to end debate on the nomination, days after Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee boycotted a vote to advance Barrett's nomination. The only Republicans who voted against the cloture motion on Sunday were Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. On Saturday, Murkowski previewed her intentions, saying she planned to vote against moving the nomination forward procedurally but would vote to confirm Barrett on Monday. \"While I oppose the process that led us to this point, I do not hold it against her, as an individual who has navigated the gauntlet with grace, skill and humility,\" she said. Collins faces a tough reelection battle and said after Ginsburg's death in September that whoever wins the presidential election should fill the Supreme Court vacancy . The 48-year-old judge's confirmation solidifies the court's conservative majority, potentially shaping the future of abortion rights and health care law for generations.

{"claim": "When Joe Biden was US vice-president they took a month to act on information that might have saved Kayla Mueller, a humanitarian worker held hostage and sexually abused by the Islamic State terrorist group", "label": "Supported", "result": {"response": "To assess the factual accuracy of the statement regarding Joe Biden's actions as Vice President in relation to Kayla Mueller, we need to analyze the context and details surrounding the situation.\n\n1. **Background on Kayla Mueller**: Kayla Mueller was an American humanitarian worker who was kidnapped by the Islamic State (ISIS) in August 2013. She was held captive for several months and was reported to have been sexually abused by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\n2. **Timeline of Events**: Kayla Mueller was captured in 2013, and her family received communication from her captors. Reports indicate that she was killed in February 2015, although the exact circumstances of her death were not confirmed until later.\n\n3. **U.S. Government Response**: The U.S. government, including the Obama administration (of which Joe Biden was Vice President), was involved in efforts to secure her release. However, the specific details about the timeline of actions taken by the U.S. government in response to the information regarding her captivity are complex and involve intelligence assessments, negotiations, and military considerations.\n\n4. **Claims of Delay**: The statement claims that there was a month-long delay in acting on information that could have saved her. This assertion would require specific evidence of what information was available, when it was received, and what actions were or were not taken by the U.S. government during that time.\n\n5. **Public Statements and Investigations**: There have been various investigations and reports regarding the U.S. government's handling of the situation, including criticisms of the response. However, the assertion that a specific month-long delay directly correlates to the failure to save Kayla Mueller is a strong claim that would need to be substantiated with clear evidence.\n\nIn summary, while there were indeed criticisms of the U.S. government's response to Kayla Mueller's kidnapping, the specific claim that they took a month to act on information that might have saved her is not definitively supported by the available evidence. The situation is complex, and while there may have been delays, attributing her death directly to a specific month-long inaction requires more concrete evidence than what is presented in the statement.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement is likely an oversimplification of a complex situation.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "against Joe Biden in Ukraine in 2019. [ 36 ] New York Post reporting On October 14, 2020, the New York Post published articles containing purported emails of unknown authorship which suggested that Hunter Biden provided an \"opportunity\" to Vadym Pozharskyi, an advisor to the board of Burisma, to meet his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden. [ 2 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Joe Biden stated in September 2019 that he had never spoken to his son about his foreign business dealings. [ 39 ] His presidential campaign denied such a meeting took place and stated the New York Post had never contacted them \"about the critical elements of this story\". [ 40 ] Michael Carpenter, Vice President Biden's foreign policy adviser in 2015, told The Washington Post that he had accompanied Joe Biden during all of his meetings about Ukraine: \"He never met with [Pozharskyi]. In fact, I had never heard of this guy until the New York Post story broke.\" [ 41 ] One of the purported emails showed Pozharskyi saying he would share information with Amos Hochstein , a State Department advisor close to Vice President Biden, though Hochstein stated, \"The Republican Senate investigation subpoenaed all my records, including emails and calendars and found no mention of this man. I led the US energy efforts in Ukraine and never even heard of him before yesterday.\" [ 42 ] According to an investigation by The New York Times, editors at the New York Post \"pressed staff members to add their bylines to the story\", and at least one refused, in addition to the original author, reportedly because of a lack of confidence in its credibility. Of the two writers eventually credited on the article, the second did not know her name was attached to it until after The Post published it. [ 33 ] In its opening sentence, the New York Post story misleadingly asserted, \"the elder Biden pressured government officials in Ukraine into firing a prosecutor who was investigating\" Burisma, even though Shokin had not pursued an investigation into Burisma's founder. [ 41 ] The opening sentence also misleadingly stated that Hunter Biden introduced his father to Pozharskyi, but the purported email from Pozharskyi only mentioned an invitation and \"opportunity\" for the men to meet. [ 43 ] [ 44 ] On October 15, the Post published another article regarding a business venture relating to\nBiden and the Burisma advisor Vadym Pozharskyi. The Biden campaign denied Joe Biden had any meeting with Pozharskyi and said that if they had ever met, it would have been a brief encounter. [ 28 ] Witnesses at the dinner where they allegedly met said Joe Biden briefly passed by to see an old friend. The Post reported in its story that Pozharskyi declined to comment, and he did not comment to a Politico journalist who reported extensively on the story a year later. [ 29 ] The Post reported that the email was found in a cache of data extracted from the external hard drive of a laptop computer that belonged to Hunter Biden. The Post reported that the repair shop owner had made a copy of the external hard drive before it was seized by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and that the copy was later provided to the Post by Donald Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani . The subpoena to seize the laptop was issued by a grand jury on behalf of the US attorney's office in Wilmington, which was later reported to have been investigating Hunter Biden about lobbying and financial matters since at least 2018. [ 1 ] [ 12 ] The veracity of the Post 's reporting was strongly questioned by many mainstream media outlets and analysts due to the initially unclear origin and chain of custody of the laptop and the provenance of its contents. Due to prior Russian influence campaigns during the 2016 election, particularly the release of documents obtained by Russian cyber attacks targeting John Podesta and the Democratic National Committee , media outlets and intelligence officials also became suspicious of a possible disinformation campaign by Russian intelligence or its proxies. Analysts also suspected Russian involvement in the 2017 leaks of emails involving French president Emmanuel Macron two days before national elections, which contained fake emails mingled with genuine ones.

A childhood steeped in tragedy Getty Images Hunter (second from right) at his father's 30th birthday party Born in Wilmington, Delaware, in 1970 to Joe Biden and his first wife Neilia, Hunter was given his mother's maiden name as his first name. He was only two years old in December 1972 when - less than six weeks after his father's election to the US Senate - a truck rammed into the family car. The accident took the lives of his mother and his baby sister Naomi, while leaving him with a fractured skull and his older brother Beau with a broken leg. Joe Biden - who was not in the car - took his oath of office by their bedside in hospital. Getty Images Hunter (extreme left) looks on with his family after Joe Biden announces his first run for the presidency in 1988 Hunter later attended Georgetown University and Yale Law School, graduating in 1996. Between the two degrees, he joined the Jesuit Volunteer Corps, a Catholic group that serves marginalised communities. There, he met his first wife, Kathleen Buhle, a lawyer, and they wed in 1993. They have three children - Naomi, Finnegan and Maisy - but the pair split in 2017. The 'darkness' of addiction His father is teetotal, but Hunter started drinking as a teenager and has acknowledged abusing cocaine as a college student. He has been in and out of rehab. In 2013, he signed up for the US Navy Reserve and was sworn in before his father - then the vice-president - in a White House ceremony. But on his very first day at the naval base, he tested positive for cocaine use and was discharged. Getty Images Hunter walks with his then-wife Kathleen, father Joe and step-mother Jill in 2009 According to the New Yorker, he drank excessively after the death of his older brother, Beau, from brain cancer in 2015, sometimes only leaving the house to buy vodka. \"He and Beau were one,\" his daughter, Naomi, once wrote\nits coverage came from a Delaware computer repairman and not the Kremlin \u2014 but, after preemptively discrediting the world exclusive to Big Tech, the FBI kept silent publicly as 51 ex-intelligence officials suggested and then-candidate Joe Biden outright alleged that the files came from Russia. The Post\u2019s reporting showed that Biden, while vice president, interacted with international business associates of his son Hunter and brother James \u2014 including in countries where he helped steer US policy, such as China and Ukraine. The reports were widely, if belatedly, corroborated by other news outlets and the files were even used by federal prosecutors in court \u2014 but only after Biden defeated Trump in November 2020 by narrow swing-state margins, which some Republicans say was in part due to the cloud of suspicion over the laptop. Repairman-turned-whistleblower John Paul Mac Isaac provided the laptop, which Hunter failed to retrieve, to the FBI in December 2019, believing it had significant information about international corruption. He later provided copies of the same files to The Post. Congressional Republicans accuse the FBI and tech platforms of collaborating to defeat Trump in the last election \u2014 a perception that social media company employees were aware of at the time. \u201c[W]hen we get hauled up to [Capitol] [H]ill to testify on why we influenced the 2020 elections we can say we have been meeting for YEARS with USG [the US Government] to plan for it,\u201d a Facebook employee wrote in a July 15, 2020, message published in the new report.

In response to the deadly violence perpetrated by Fields, Trump claimed that there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d and in the first presidential debate refused to condemn violent right-wing groups. His remarks were widely criticized. Are they really a threat? At least one death has been attributed to a person affiliated wth the Antifa movement. On August 29, a member of the far-right group \u201cPatriot Prayer\u201d who was part of a pro-Trump caravan in Portland, Oregon, died after being shot . The man accused of the killing, Michael Reinoehl, was shot by US marshals five days later. Overall, however, data show that Antifa activists have been involved in relatively few violent incidents compared to white supremacists, who have conducted at least 40 lethal attacks since 2018 according to the Department of Homeland Security. Despite this, Trump and his attorney general, William Barr, have accused the Antifa movement of being the main instigators of violence, looting and public unrest. This is what serves as justification for the administration\u2019s labeling them as \u201ca domestic terrorist group\u201d. For both legal and political reasons, such accusations are immediately met with scepticism and criticism. Because the United States has no domestic terror law \u2013 something opposed by both progressive and conservative public officials \u2013 the only possibility would be to place the Antifa movement on the list of \u201cforeign terrorist organizations\u201d, something that has no basis in fact. The alternative would be take thousands of activists to court, thus criminalizing political beliefs and violating fundamental rights guaranteed by the US Constitution. A polarized country So does the Antifa movement represent a real threat to American democracy? Let us look more broadly at the partisan, political conflict that is being felt across the country. The Antifa movement is part of a polarization of political views that is eroding one the foundations of the American republic, the mutual recognition of the legitimacy of both political sides. The groups against which the Antifa movement positions itself, including white supremacists, neo-fascists and right-wing nationalists , have been involved in numerous violent actions and killings . However, the Antifa movement\u2019s own actions can contribute to the legitimization of violence, escalate conflicts rather than defuse them, and expose peaceful protesters to danger.

The shooting came at the end of a day of competing rallies by far-right and far-left demonstrators. Helen H. Richardson/MediaNews Group/The Denver Post via Getty Images One person was killed and another man is in police custody after a fatal shooting in Denver on Saturday that occurred toward the end of dueling rallies by activists on the far right and the far left. The Denver Police Department said it had taken a private security guard into custody in connection with the shooting. On Sunday, the department identified the suspect as 30-year-old Matthew Dolloff. He has not been formally charged. A local news channel, 9News, said it had contracted Dolloff through the Pinkerton security firm as a guard to accompany staff covering the protest. Contracting private security to protect reporters and producers at protests has been a practice at the outlet for several months, 9News said. The shooting took place near the Denver Art Museum when competing far-left and far-right protests were winding down nearby. Activists from the far left were in the area for a Black Lives Matter Anti-Fascist Soup Drive organized by the Denver Communists, the Colorado Socialist Revolution and other groups, according to Colorado Public Radio . The right-wing demonstrators had gathered for what was billed as a Patriot Muster organized by John \"Tig\"\n7, 2021 That man was later identified as Jake Angeli, a noted supporter of a conspiracy cult called Qanon and a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump. Angeli is a well-known protester covered previously by Arizona Central . Supporters had planned the events online , using social media apps like Parler to express support for the rallies scheduled on Thursday. Other false claims also indicated that Antifa protestors were \u201cescorted\u201d into the Capitol by police to cause the disruption. Metropolitan police denied the claim, telling Reuters they do not act as a private security escort. If the identification of well-known right-wing activists is not convincing enough to dispel the notion that Antifa was involved in the Capitol, consider Trump\u2019s own messages to the rioters he was telling to go home. \u201cWe love you, you\u2019re very special,\u201d he told them in a video that was later taken down by Twitter and Facebook. \u201cBut go home, and go home in peace.\u201d Copyright 2021 by KSAT - All rights reserved.

Johnson has since said that he doesn't want the violent actions of a few to be used to impugn all. Rep. Andrew Clyde, after watching video footage of rioters walking through the Capitol, said it resembled a \"normal tourist visit.\" Other video evidence from Jan. 6 showed Clyde, R-Ga., helping barricade the House doors in an attempt to keep the rioters out. Trump called the insurrection a display of \" spirit and faith and love .\" Rioters also broke windows and doors, stole items from offices and caused an estimated $1.5 million in damage. Outside the Capitol someone set up a gallows with a noose . \"The notion that this was somehow a tourist event is disgraceful and despicable,\" Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said in May. \"And, you know, I won't be part of whitewashing what happened on Jan. 6. Nobody should be part of it. And people ought to be held accountable.\" ___ CLAIM: TRUMP DID NOT ENCOURAGE THE RIOTERS Trump may now want to minimize his involvement, but he spent months sounding a steady drumbeat of conspiracy theory and grievance, urging his followers to fight to somehow return him to power. \"Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,\" Trump tweeted on Dec. 19, 2020. \"Be there, will be wild!\" Immediately before the mob stormed the Capitol, Trump spoke for more than an hour, telling his supporters they had been \"cheated\" and \"defrauded\" in the \"rigged\" election by a \"criminal enterprise\" that included lawmakers who were now meeting in the Capitol. At one point, Trump did urge his supporters to \"peacefully and patriotically make your voice heard.\" The rest of his speech was filled with hostile rhetoric. \"We fight. We fight like hell,\" he told those who would later break into the Capitol. \"And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\" Now, Trump says he had nothing to do with the riot. \"I wasn't involved in that, and if you look at my words and what I said in the speech, they were extremely calming actually,\" Trump said on Fox News in December. Nearly two-thirds of Americans believe Trump bears some responsibility for the Capitol breach, according to a survey last year by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. ___ CLAIM: ASHLI BABBITT WAS KILLED BY AN"}], "source": "rag_only"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 5, "concluded_by_rag": true, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.4}

On Twitter alt-right activists, conservative journalists, and others who had urged Clinton's prosecution over the emails - took up the \"pizzagate\" cause with renewed vigour. Image source, @cernovich/Twitter Image source, @BrittPettibone/Twitter Despite the complete lack of physical evidence or victim testimony, there are reasons why the hardcore conspiracy theorists are particularly sensitive to allegations of child sex abuse. It's known, for instance that Bill Clinton and Donald Trump flew on the private plane of convicted child abuser Jeffery Epstein , external . Tony Podesta, the brother of the Clinton aide whose emails were hacked, was a friend of Dennis Hastert, a Republican politician who earlier this year was sentenced to 15 months in prison , and has admitted abusing boys. The Jimmy Savile scandal in the UK has featured in speculation as an example of a serial child abuser getting away with his crimes. Viren Swami, professor of social psychology at Anglia Ruskin University, says \"pizzagate\" might well be an example of a trend in a hyper-partisan America, where conspiracy theories become fodder for political factions. \"What's happening in the US over the last year or two is that conspiracy theorising is being deployed as a political weapon,\" he says. \"And that's a very big change in the way that conspiracy narratives are being used.\" The saga has prompted debunkers by the New York Times , external and Fox News , external , among many others, but no factual news story has slowed the torrent of Tweets from the true believers. \"There is some evidence that presenting critical information can reduce belief in a theory, but only among people who have not made up their minds yet,\" Swami says. \"For the people who have already made up their minds, it probably won't change anything.\" Other stories have fuelled the rumours and prompted claims of a cover up.

Gender Affirming Care . The Trump administration has issued an order titled \u201cDefending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,\u201d which essentially removes the concept of gender identity from federal government policies and procedures, including removing health care afforded to people on that basis. President Trump also rescinded a number of orders from the Biden-era that promoted protections on the basis of sex and gender identity in schools, and did away with the Gender Policy Council. These new orders are consistent with the President\u2019s promises on the campaign trail and in his inauguration speech, but legal challenges are likely. 6. Immigration . Another Biden-era policy rescinded by President Trump includes a policy not to arrest people without legal residency at or near \u201csensitive locations,\u201d which includes hospitals, which Congress had attempted to formalize in 2023. The purpose of the rescission is to boost the ability of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to enforce immigration laws. The effect on health care is that immigrants could potentially be arrested in hospitals and while receiving medical care. Health care providers and facilities should pay close attention to immigration policy updates under the Trump administration. 7. Covid-19 . President Trump acted to revoke several policies implemented by former President Biden, the purpose of which were aimed at responding to the Covid-19 pandemic and future infectious disease outbreaks by bolstering testing, research into treatments, providing economic relief, and enhancing cooperation with other countries in the event of another pandemic. For the most part, these rescissions remove lingering policies that have run their course after the Covid-19 pandemic. 8. Abortion Spending . President Trump has signed an Executive Order to end the use of Federal taxpayer dollars to fund or promote \u201celective abortion\u201d by reinstating the Hyde Amendment, which was passed in 1976 and attached Medicaid appropriations to the restriction of federal funding from supporting abortions. On the same day, President Trump also signed an Order reinstating the Mexico City Policy, which had been rescinded by former President Biden. The Mexico City Policy requires foreign nongovernmental agencies to certify that they don\u2019t provide or promote abortion if they receive U.S. federal funds for family planning assistance. Also on Friday, President Trump\u2019s administration directed federal prosecutors to scale back enforcement of the Freedom of Access to Clinical Entrances (FACE) Act.

Chuck Schumer have an affair with a 16-year-old girl ? A: No. That claim was originally made up by a self-described satirical website, but has been circulating on right-wing social media accounts as though it happened. FULL ANSWER What started out as a joke has turned into ammunition for right-wing social media accounts to defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of committing sexual assault in the 1980s. The transformation from parody to recrimination took place over the course of almost a year. Here\u2019s how it happened: In December 2017, America\u2019s Last Line of Defense, a site that describes its content as satire aimed at provoking conservatives, posted a made-up story claiming that Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer had impregnated a 16-year-old girl. The hoax story was related to allegations at the time that Roy Moore , the Republican who lost a special Senate election in Alabama, had pursued sexual relationships with underage girls when he was in his 30s. The bogus Schumer story was then copied by other websites that presented it as if it were real and without a satire disclaimer. A conspiracy-theorist blogger and YouTube personality then took the story and embellished it in a post headlined: \u201c BREAKING: Chuck Schumer, Democrat Senate Minority Leader, Accused of Raping His Daughter\u2019s 16 Year Old Friend: Friend Then \u2018Committed Suicide\u2019 \u201d That post became the basis of a recent attack on Schumer by Lori Hendry , a popular Twitter personality who describes herself as an \u201cunapologetic conservative.\u201d Hendry, who has about 246,000 followers, shared the false story about Schumer in a tweet defending Kavanaugh. Dear Chuck Schumer you were accused of raping your daughter\u2019s 16-year-old friend who then committed suicide. u categorically denied guilt. Judge Kavanaugh is accused of a much lesser accusation and emphatically denying it too so why do you gounscathed and he is being crucified? \u2014 Lori Hendry (@Lrihendry) September 18, 2018 Hendry\u2019s tweet was retweeted 15,000 times and liked 23,000 times. It then migrated to Facebook, where it was shared thousands of times as a meme. But there are red flags that the story is not true. For example, it claims that Schumer\u2019s daughter, \u201cLisa Schumer,\u201d exposed her father\u2019s past relationship with her childhood\nto stop the spread of conspiracy theories. Trump Retweets Dated, Racially Charged Post President Trump retweeted a video, which had been posted under the misleading heading \u201cBlack Lives Matter/Antifa,\u201d of a Black man shoving a white woman into a stopped subway car. The incident occurred on Oct. 23, 2019, and there is no indication that the man in the video was affiliated with either Black Lives Matter or antifa.

Full Episode Monday, Feb 2\nFact check US: Is there an \u2018antifa threat\u2019 in the United States, as Donald Trump claims? Antifa activists on the streets of Salem, Oregon, at a rally of extreme right-wing groups such as the Patriot Prayer and the Proud Boys on September 7. Allison Dinner/AFP Ever since the antiracism protests that followed the May 25 death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers, President Donald Trump has repeatedly asserted that that Antifa (short for \u201cantifascist\u201d) groups threaten American democracy. On September 30, he once again called them (in his usual style) \u201ca very bad group\u201d , which he says should be considered a \u201cterrorist organization\u201d. The origins of the antifascist movement The term refers more to an amorphous movement than an association, a flexible network of activists who share a general philosophy, sometimes try to coordinate their activities, but generally operate spontaneously, responding to events at a highly local level. There\u2019s no hierarchy, official status or precise system of organization. Local groups are independent and do not announce their actions ahead of time. The number of members varies, increasing or decreasing depending on the circumstances. Sometimes they can work with loosely structured organizations such as Black Lives Matter, other times they work by themselves. Their sometimes violent actions have been rejected by many protest organizers working for causes that Antifa groups care about \u2013 authoritarianism and antifascism, racism, homophobia and xenophobia, for example. All this means that it is difficult to establish the exact genealogy of the Antifa movement. The oldest group in operation, Rose City Antifa , was created in Portland, Oregon, in 2007, with the aim of shutting down a neo-Nazi music festival. While Trump singled out the Antifa movement after his election, they gained prominence after the tragic events in Charlottesville, Virginia, on August 11, 2017. That day a rally by white supremacists and neo-Nazis also attracted counter-protestors, including Antifa activists. They were demonstrating peacefully when James Alex Fields Jr., a white supremacist, drove his car into the crowd, killing one person and injuring more than a dozen others. Fields\u2019s actions were deemed a terrorist attack and he currently in prison serving two life sentences without the possibility of parole. In response to the deadly violence perpetrated by Fields, Trump claimed that there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d and in the first presidential debate refused to condemn violent right-wing groups.

PMJJBY provides life insurance coverage, while PMSBY offers accidental death and disability coverage. Both schemes are aimed at providing financial security to families in case of the policyholder's death.\n\n2. **COVID-19 Context**: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Indian government announced various measures to support families affected by the virus, including financial assistance for those who lost their lives due to COVID-19. This assistance can include claims under existing insurance schemes like PMJJBY and PMSBY.\n\n3. **Claim Process**: Families of deceased individuals can claim insurance benefits under these schemes if the deceased was enrolled in them at the time of death. The claims process typically requires documentation proving the cause of death and the policyholder's enrollment in the schemes.\n\nGiven this information, the statement that the Government of India is providing money to bereaved families of COVID-19 victims through insurance benefits under PMJJBY and PMSBY is accurate.

We find these erroneous and egregious charges leveled against doctors \u2013 which have been repeated during the past few weeks \u2013 dismaying, disconcerting and disturbing. Hospitals and health systems are eligible to receive higher payments for complex COVID-19-related treatment under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act \u2013 that much is true. But there are several myths out there too. For months, we have been setting the record straight , and we continue to do so . Hospitals do not receive extra funds when patients die from COVID-19. They are not over-reporting COVID-19 cases. And, they are not making money on treating COVID-19. The truth is, hospitals and health systems are in their worst financial shape in decades due to COVID-19. In some cases, the situation is truly dire. An AHA report estimates total losses for our nation\u2019s hospitals and health systems of least $323 billion in 2020. There is no windfall here. Further, hospitals and health systems adhere to strict coding guidelines , and use of the COVID-19 code for Medicare claims is reserved for confirmed cases. Coding inappropriately can result in criminal penalties and exclusion from the Medicare program altogether. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , there have been as many as 299,028 more deaths this year compared to a typical year (as of Oct. 15, 2020). There have been 216,025 deaths due to COVID-19. There is no reasonable explanation for the increased deaths other than COVID-19. The professionals of America\u2019s hospitals and health systems are focused on saving lives and treating illnesses \u2013 period. They shouldn\u2019t have to waste precious time debunking theories that are offensive and untrue. The AHA stands with our physicians, nurses and front-line caregivers as they continue to battle COVID-19. As American Medical Association President Susan Bailey, M.D., said, \u201cRather than attacking us and lobbing baseless charges at physicians, our leaders should be following the science and urging adherence to the public health steps we know work \u2013 wearing a mask, washing hands and practicing physical distancing.\u201d Rick Pollack is president and CEO of the AHA.

Susan Collins regarding President Donald Trump, we need to analyze the components of the statement and compare them with the provided knowledge.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statement**: The statement claims that Sen. Susan Collins said she wouldn't endorse Trump but still fully supports him. This indicates a nuanced position where she separates endorsement from support.\n\n2. **Key Points from the Knowledge**: \n   - The knowledge does not provide specific quotes or context from Sen. Collins regarding her stance on Trump.\n   - It is important to verify if there is any record of her saying she wouldn't endorse Trump and then later expressing full support.\n\n3. **Researching Context**: \n   - Historically, Sen. Collins has had a complicated relationship with Trump, often expressing criticism while also acknowledging support for certain policies or actions.\n   - There have been instances where she has stated she would not endorse him, particularly during the 2016 election cycle and in subsequent years.\n\n4. **Evaluating the Claim**: \n   - If Collins did indeed say she wouldn't endorse Trump but later stated she fully supports him, the statement would be accurate.\n   - However, if there is no record of her making such a statement or if the context is misrepresented, the claim would be false.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Without specific knowledge confirming that Collins made the exact statement as quoted, we cannot definitively say it is true. However, given her history of mixed messages regarding Trump, it is plausible that she could have expressed such sentiments.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, I conclude that the statement is likely to be **False** due to the lack of evidence supporting the exact phrasing and context of her support.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 0, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.4}

This new virus was first identified in the city of Wuhan in the Hubei province 1 . Since then, it has spread to over 203 countries, and was officially declared as a global pandemic illness by the World Health Organization (WHO) 2 . After almost 2 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has left a toll of 446 million infected and more than 6.0 million deaths worldwide 3 . From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of facemasks (FMs) has been controversial due to political, cultural and economic causes. However, multiple studies have highlighted the efficiency of FM in the reduction of COVID-19 transmission (i.e., from 6 to 80%) 4 . In another report the use of medical/surgical masks reduced the transmission rates by 85% 5 . Countries worldwide have adapted many different approaches to control the disease 6 . Non-pharmaceutical actions included the use gowns, gloves, and FM, all of which have been proven to be effective and more recently, the use of vaccines such as the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine, Curevac, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Sino pharm has proven effective in the control of the pandemic 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 . Some side effects associated with the use of FMs have been reported. The most common side effect described by healthcare workers was bilateral headaches (affecting up to 80% of users), dermatitis, itchy rash and elevated heart rates 11 . However, the WHO has advised populations to wear FMs on a large scale only excluding patients with limited respiratory conditions 4 . Recently updated guidelines issued by the WHO advised the use of FMs as part of its prevention recommendations which also included hand hygiene, physical distance of at least 1 m, avoidance of face touching and adequate indoor ventilation 2 , 12 . Previous clinical studies have addressed the potential impact of FMs on brain and cognitive functions 13 , 14 . One study in healthy young people showed that the 150-min use of surgical mask had no significant mental fatigue perception 13 while another showed that the prolonged use of FMs can result in headache and impaired\nFact check: Experts say face masks don't cause oxygen deprivation FACT CHECK Coronavirus COVID-19 Add Topic Fact check: Experts say face masks don't cause oxygen deprivation, neurological damage Devan Patel Palm Beach Post Oct. 17, 2020 Updated Oct. 19, 2020, 12:15 p.m. ET The claim: Masks cause oxygen deprivation and neurological damage, especially in children COVID-19 has killed more than 1.1 million people worldwide, including more than 219,000 in the USA in less than a year. Despite data that masks slow the spread of the virus, skepticism exists regarding their use. Deniers vary in the reasons for their opposition. One claim that continues to surface in social media posts is that masks cause oxygen deprivation in the brain. A viral Facebook post transcribing a video message by neurologist Margareta Griesz-Brisson, which was removed by YouTube for violating its terms of service, says masks can cause neurological damage, especially in children. \u201cThe rebreathing of our exhaled air will without a doubt create oxygen deficiency and a flooding of carbon dioxide. We know that the human brain is very sensitive to oxygen deprivation. There are nerve cells, for example in the hippocampus, that can\u2019t be longer than three minutes without oxygen \u2013 they cannot survive,\u201d the post said. The Facebook user did not answer whether she fact-checked the information before creating the post. Evidence does not support that masks are dangerous Medical experts dispute claims of masks dropping oxygen to dangerous levels. \u201cWhile masks can block particles like respiratory droplets and aerosols that might contain coronavirus, they do not block gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide,\u201d said Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech and an expert in airborne disease transmission. \u201cA recent study of people wearing surgical masks while walking around found no significant changes in carbon dioxide in their breath nor oxygen in their blood, compared to walking without a mask.\u201d Jonathan Parsons, a pulmonologist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and director of the Ohio State Asthma Center, addressed those claims in a post on the medical center\u2019s website. \u201cFortunately, the flurry of complaints has also given rise to a number of highly effective demonstrations in which medical professionals display their excellent oxygen levels while trying on different masks \u2013 and sometimes multiple masks at once,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBelieve these demonstrations, because they\u2019re true.

Rating: False About this rating In September 2020, as social media users accused Netflix of promoting pedophilia due to a promotional poster for the award-winning French film \"Cuties,\" the website TorontoToday.net published an article claiming that Reed Hastings, the streaming service's CEO, had been arrested on suspicion of possession of child pornography: This is not a genuine news report. Hastings was not arrested by the FBI, and the accusations circulating on social media that the Netflix CEO was involved in child pornography are baseless and largely driven by pedophilia panic that consumed portions of the internet in 2020. Hasting is the CEO of one of the world's largest streaming services. If he truly had been arrested by the FBI, it would certainly warrant a press release from the FBI, and would undoubtedly make headlines in credible media outlets. However, the only source for this news appears to be random social media posts and an article published to a website with a history of spreading misinformation. TorontoToday.net is a relatively new website, but it has already been responsible for at least two viral hoaxes. Shortly after Black Panther actor Chadwick Boseman died from colon cancer, the website published a false report claiming that he had been poisoned. The website was also responsible for the false rumor that Russian President Vladimir Putin's daughter had died from a COVID-19 vaccine. The website deleted its false report about Hasting's arrest, but an archived version of the page can be found here . It appears that TorontoToday.net originally published this article under the headline \"Netflix CEO gets BUSTED with 13,000 files of CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.\" Then, the site updated the article to include the word \"reports\" before the headline, and deleted the original text of the article claiming a\nFact check: False claim that Netflix CEO Reed Hastings arrested FACT CHECK fact-checking Add Topic Fact check: False claim that Netflix CEO Reed Hastings was arrested for child pornography Camille Caldera USA TODAY Sept. 17, 2020, 1:36 p.m. ET The claim: Netflix CEO Reed Hastings was arrested for child pornography Netflix has faced significant backlash \u2014 including from Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton, and Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard \u2014 over its recent release of the film \"Cuties,\" which has been criticized for sexualizing young girls. Amid the controversy, unfounded claims about Netflix CEO Reed Hastings have swirled on social media. Posts on Facebook and Instagram included a screenshot of a headline that claimed \"Netflix CEO gets BUSTED with 13,000 files of CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.\" The headline came from an article on the webpage Toronto Today. The story \u2014 which was archived on Sept. 12 prior to its removal from the site \u2014 claimed that Hastings was arrested at his home in California and faces \"11 charges related to the seizure of more than 13,000 files of graphic child pornography on his computer and various removable storage units.\" The users behind the posts did not respond to requests from USA TODAY for comment. Toronto Today denied being the original source of the false story, and noted in an email to USA TODAY that Netflix and Hastings have faced accusations of distributing child pornography since the release of \"Cuties.\" Story is false, details taken from an unrelated arrest of someone else in December 2019 The claims in the screenshots and the story from Toronto Today are false. No reputable media outlets reported the alleged arrest, and no law enforcement agencies \u2014 including the Federal Bureau of Investigations, which the article claims made the arrest \u2014 issued any press releases or statements to that effect. Numerous details in the article by Toronto Today appeared to be lifted from a report on ABC4 in December 2019, which detailed the arrest of Douglas Saltsman, a Utah CEO. Copied details include the number and content of the files, including the age of children and the nature of the sexual abuse, and evidence of a \"clandestine drug lab\" discovered during the raid.

Hastings has not been charged with child pornography. See the sources for this fact-check If you\u2019ve been binge-watching Netflix shows to get through the lows of the coronavirus pandemic, you might have been shocked to see online claims about the alleged criminal behavior of the company\u2019s CEO. \"Kim Martin Morrow the CEO of Netflix has just been charged with 15 charges for child pornography and 31,000 files have been found on his personal computers for child porn from ages 8 and as young as toddlers,\" reads the text of a post that has been copied numerous times on different social media platforms. \"So, I think the investigation was needed. #SaveOurChildren.\" The text often accompanies a link to a story titled: \"Sen. Ted Cruz calls for a criminal investigation into Netflix film 'Cuties.'\" The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. ( Read more about our partnership with Facebook. ) Netflix\u2019s CEO has not been charged with these crimes. The claims have been debunked several times, but some social media users continue to spread the misinformation. Netflix CEO First, the claim incorrectly identifies Netflix\u2019s CEO. Reed Hastings is the CEO and co-founder of Netflix. PolitiFact searched news archives and found no evidence that Hastings had been charged with any crime. It\u2019s not clear where the name \u2018Kim Martin Morrow\u2019 originated; our searches find it solely used with these inaccurate claims. Not one of Netflix\u2019s eight senior officers or 12 directors is named Kim Martin Morrow. So why are social media users falsely linking a fake Netflix CEO to child pornography charges? That\u2019s a bit complicated. Child pornography claims The child pornography claims come after Netflix\u2019s release of the French film \u2018Cuties\u2019 was met with criticism from subscribers and other internet users. Many say the film inappropriately\ncan be found here . It appears that TorontoToday.net originally published this article under the headline \"Netflix CEO gets BUSTED with 13,000 files of CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.\" Then, the site updated the article to include the word \"reports\" before the headline, and deleted the original text of the article claiming a threat of legal action from a \"billionaire we won't name.\" Unfortunately, we have received threats of litigation over the original article posted on Toronto Today from a Billionaire that we won\u2019t name. Upon consideration, we have removed the original article from the website, and from Toronto Today-controlled Facebook and Twitter accounts. It\u2019s not worth the risk. We apologize for any confusion.

This fake report about the arrest of Netflix CEO Reed Hasting is just the latest in a long series of false rumors concerning pedophilia. In 2020, pedophilia panic consumed portions of the internet, in large part because these false rumors were being amplified by the growing QAnon conspiracy movement. In the last few months alone, we've covered false rumors about furniture stores trafficking children via large cabinets , department stores promoting pedophilia by selling shirts containing images of pizza , and the country of Greece classifying pedophilia as a disability. While pedophilia and sex trafficking are certainly real issues, the aforementioned stories are false. In fact, the National Human Trafficking Hotline released a statement saying that these pedophilia conspiracy theories were making it more difficult to help people who are actually in danger of being trafficked.

Thousands of demonstrators turned out to protest police brutality, and some destroyed police cars, damaged businesses and burned down several buildings. On Aug. 25, the third night of protests, Rittenhouse, then 17, drove from his home in Illinois across the state line into Wisconsin, where he armed himself with an AR-15-style rifle loaded with 30 rounds.

After the outbreak started, the White House continued to defy recommendations from scientists and health authorities to prevent or contain the virus\u2019 spread. For instance, the president\u2019s medical team declined to say when the president last tested negative for the virus. His medical team issued contradictory statements about the timeline for his diagnosis and the severity of his symptoms \u2014 at one point admitting that they misrepresented his condition to avoid causing alarm \u2014 and flouted experts\u2019 guidelines for isolation to stop the spread of the virus. The president may have also risked the health of Secret Service agents when he decided to leave the hospital to greet his supporters from his motorcade just one day after he began a steroid treatment used for patients with severe responses to Covid-19 (a decision one attending physician at Walter Reed described as \u201c insanity \u201d). Shortly after returning to the White House (and less than six days after he announced testing positive), the president met in person with aides, despite warnings from medical experts that he could have still been infectious at the time. Just two days later, Trump held an in-person rally for hundreds of supporters on the White House lawn (which, in addition to raising serious safety concerns, may have violated the Hatch Act). Since his diagnosis, the president has also continued to undermine the authority and legitimacy of federal public health agencies and experts and spread misinformation. In the midst of his intensive Covid-19 treatment, Trump urged the public, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of Covid. Don\u2019t let it dominate your life,\u201d contradicting warnings from the CDC and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease Director Dr. Anthony Fauci about the seriousness of the disease. Less than five days after first receiving an experimental drug, Trump touted it as a miracle \u201ccure,\u201d even though the drug had not completed clinical trials. He also pressured the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to make it available to the public immediately, thwarting the agency\u2019s process for ensuring the safety of new drugs and vaccines, including on an emergency basis. The president\u2019s defiance of public health guidance and downplaying of the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic in the wake of his own diagnosis are part of a long pattern of sidelining and undermining the federal government\u2019s public health apparatus. As documented below, his administration has repeatedly\ntweets criticism of Trump and claims to live in rural California. An archived version of the tweet can be viewed here , establishing its authenticity, and the authenticity of its date. No evidence exists to demonstrate that Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis was anything other than real, and @JohnCammo appears to have been engaging in no more than idle speculation. For one thing, Trump \"emerged\" from his illness \u2014 he returned to the White House from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center four days after his diagnosis, not 14 \u2014 and as of Oct. 6, the White House has not stated that he was treated with hydroxychloroquine. Many other Twitter users made similar predictions of Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis. As one of the most talked-about public figures alive today, and as a 74-year-old man engaging in the activities of a presidential reelection campaign, it was inevitable that at least some social media users would speculate that Trump would contract COVID-19. One demonstrably false conspiracy theory held that Trump would be falsely diagnosed with COVID-19 before the first presidential debate on Sept. 29, thus providing an excuse for him to withdraw from all three debates against Democratic opponent Joe Biden. Conversely, several supporters of Trump promoted the same false conspiracy theory about the former vice president, predicting that Biden would be \"conveniently\" stricken by the illness in order to skip the debates: The Sept. 18 tweet posted by @JohnCammo was authentic, although the specific theory advanced was either refuted or not supported by the available evidence. The prevalence of similar predictions by other social media users, about both Trump and Biden, demonstrates the ease with which social media users can engage in idle or malicious speculation, with little or no expectation of damage to reputations, even when they are proven wrong.

One hypothesis is that the lingering symptoms are the result of the immune system still reacting to the virus, even if infectious virus is long gone from the body. Experts also have concerns that some proportion of those who survive severe COVID-19 infections may be left with organ damage. \u201cThe amount of lung damage that we\u2019re seeing in a lot of CAT scans make me very worried about functional capacity and long-term lung function in a lot of these people who survive,\u201d Jha said. \u201cAnd so my best guess \u2014 and it is just a guess \u2014 is a sizable minority of people who end up getting infected, I don\u2019t know, 10, 20% of people will end up having meaningful long-term clinical effects of this virus.\u201d The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute launched an observational study in June to investigate the long-term health effects of having been hospitalized with COVID-19, with a special focus on the heart and lungs. Dr. Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, was asked about Trump\u2019s \u201ctotally harmless\u201d claim on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on July 5 .

Trump\u2019s doctors have acknowledged withholding information about his health after contracting COVID-19, something other administrations have done in the past. (White House photo by Tia Dufour) President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has long been a \u201cbaffling phenomenon\u201d for political historians like UC Berkeley\u2019s Martin Jay, a professor emeritus of history, who has studied political untruth for more than 50 years. The information swirling as Trump and his allies communicate strength, health and resolve in the face of the president\u2019s COVID-19 diagnosis and weekend-long hospital stay makes clear just how polarized the truth has become, he said. Martin Jay is UC Berkeley\u2019s Sidney Hellman Ehrman Professor of History Emeritus. (UC Berkeley photo) \u201cIt\u2019s no longer about whether someone is telling the truth or lying, but rather, who that person is and what our characterological assumptions are of them that makes them a truthteller or a hypocrite,\u201d said Jay. \u201cThat\u2019s a real problem \u2014 when you can\u2019t fully trust anybody anymore.\u201d Jay is the author of The Virtues of Mendacity: On Lying in Politics , a book that explores the historical role that lies and hypocrisy have played in American politics and presidencies. He spoke with Berkeley News recently about how the Trump administration\u2019s use of lies and misinformation has sowed doubt in what the public believes. Berkeley News : There are people who don\u2019t believe Trump has COVID-19. Where does that doubt come from? Martin Jay: We have developed a very complicated attitude toward people who have traditionally given us information, with many people no longer confident that they are telling the truth. This applies to both camps in our current polarized political culture. This president and his people have bent the truth so often that people don\u2019t believe what they say. They take all of it with an immense grain of salt. Trump squandered away the ability to come off as sincere, because for most of us, he lacks the fundamental capacity for sincerity. In American politics, it\u2019s always been the\n\u201ctotally harmless.\u201d In addition to those who die, many are hospitalized. In June, the CDC published data on the 1.3 million reported cases in the U.S. from Jan. 22 to May 30, finding: \u201cOverall, 184,673 (14%) patients were hospitalized, 29,837 (2%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and 71,116 (5%) died.\u201d A study published in late February by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention similarly found that 14% of cases in mainland China were severe and 5% were critical. The latter category included \u201crespiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure.\u201d The WHO also says that 13.8% of confirmed coronavirus patients have severe disease and 6.1% have critical cases. Beyond the harm caused by being sick and hospitalized, there are the financial ramifications of that treatment, the impact on hospitals of the pandemic and the burden to the U.S. health system, Riley said. And even those who have mild symptoms may transmit the infection to others. \u201cThey can still pass it on to others, who may get sick or even (tragically) die,\u201d Morse said. Lingering and Long-Term Effects Not much is known about how frequently COVID-19 patients suffer long-term effects, but there are signs that the disease does not always completely resolve itself as rapidly as expected \u2014 and is unlikely to be described as \u201charmless\u201d by many who are affected. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any long-term data because the virus has only been around for a little while,\u201d said Harvard\u2019s Jha. \u201cBut we certainly are seeing more and more cases of people with \u2026 lingering symptoms.\u201d According to the WHO, it takes about two weeks for a person to recover from a mild case of COVID-19, and three to six weeks to recover from a severe or critical one. Anecdotally, however, some patients \u2014 even those with mild cases \u2014 report months of extreme fatigue or on-and-off again symptoms such as headaches , brain fog or shortness of breath that make daily life difficult. These so-called \u201clong-haulers,\u201d as some call themselves, have shared their stories in online support groups and with journalists . One patient in the U.K. told The Atlantic that her case might be \u201cmild relative to dying in a hospital, but this virus has ruined my life.\u201d Without more data, it\u2019s difficult to know how common these complaints are or why they might be happening, but similar types of symptoms have"}], "source": "rag_only"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 5, "concluded_by_rag": true, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.4}

A career full of personal trials has also led Biden to say, as he often did ahead of announcing his plan to seek a second term, that he is a \u201c great respecter of fate. It also helped him not only build personal relationships across the aisle but was the root of what Biden aides have long called his \u201csuperpower,\u201d his empathy. Just moments after Hunter Biden delivered his statement at the Capitol on Wednesday, Joe Biden held his first in-person meeting with family members of hostages being held by Hamas terrorists. During the two-hour meeting, which began in the East Wing and included a tour of the Oval Office, Biden shared his own history of loss, specifically raising with the families about the upcoming anniversary of the 1972 accident, according to multiple attendees. \u201cHe recounted getting the worst call a parent can receive, that his wife and three children had been in a car accident right before Christmas,\u201d Yael Alexander, the mother of 19-year-old hostage American Edan Alexander, told NBC News. \u201cThere is no question he understands the longing I feel as a mother to have my son home with me during the holidays, and the urgency with which we need a deal to bring the hostages home now.\u201d A hostage parent would later say they were able to remain composed during the emotional session until the president himself teared up. Mike Memoli Mike Memoli is an NBC News correspondent. Sarah Fitzpatrick , Monica Alba and Gary Grumbach contributed .\nis he\u2019s flat lying. But Trump wasn\u2019t lying; Biden had made statements about his climate policies that critics interpreted as voicing support for a fracking prohibition. Some of those remarks are included in a campaign video that Trump has shown at recent rallies in West Salem, Wisconsin ; Circleville, Ohio ; and Martinsburg and Lititz, Pennsylvania . And some of the edited clips in that video leave out important context. To start, in the section of the video titled \u201cBiden Will Ban Fracking,\u201d it shows CNN\u2019s Dana Bash asking Biden at a July 2019 Democratic candidates debate, \u201cWould there be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking, in a Biden administration?\u201d In the Trump video, Biden answers: \u201cNo, we would \u2014 we would work it out. We would make sure it\u2019s eliminated.\u201d \u201cJoe Biden is committed to achieving a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions by 2050,\u201d his campaign said in a statement clarifying his remarks the night of that debate. \u201cHe supports eliminating subsidies for coal and gas and deploying carbon capture sequestration technology to create economic benefits for multiple industries and significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions.\u201d Next, the video shows a clip of Biden telling an environmental activist in September 2019, \u201cI guarantee you, we\u2019re going to end fossil fuel,\u201d which includes oil and gas. Then, it transitions to a video of Biden from a March 15 debate with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \u201cNo more \u2013 no new fracking,\u201d Biden says in the clip. Not shown in Trump\u2019s video is that Biden went on to say \u201cno more drilling on federal lands,\u201d which is closer to what his energy plan says. His campaign also said that night that he only meant no new permits for oil and gas drilling on federal land and offshore. After that, the video shows Biden telling CNBC in May , \u201cI\u2019d gradually move away from fracking.\u201d But Biden was even more emphatic about not banning all fracking in that interview , in which he said: \u201cThe whole idea of whether or not we\u2019re going to stop fracking, I would not stop fracking. I\u2019d gradually move away from fracking. I would just not do more fracking on federal lands. I would gradually move us out of the position of relying on oil and gas, excuse me, and coal.\u201d That part isn\u2019t in the Trump campaign video. Later in the video,\nRepublicans portray President Biden as soft on China, Paul Krugman writes, but Donald Trump \u201cnever had a coherent strategy for confronting ...\nspoke honestly and openly about his views pertaining to any and all of the questions posed to him,\u201d said Penn Political Union Chairman Dan Schweitzer in a 1985 The Daily Pennsylvanian article about one of the then-senator\u2019s visits. \u201cHe didn\u2019t pull any punches and was very candid.\u201d Gutmann, who on behalf of Penn Trustees awarded Biden an honorary degree from Penn in 2013 , and often opened her campus talks with Biden by describing him as \u201cone of our nation\u2019s foremost statesmen,\u201d says having him on campus was always a tremendous prospect for learning and education. \u201cEvery time Joe Biden, who on Wednesday will become our 46th U.S. president, visited campus, he brought forth endless expertise on a wide variety of topics\u2014from international affairs and domestic politics to immigration policy and cancer research, and so much more,\u201d Gutmann says. \u201cIn addition, his unmatched personal connections with global leaders made our mission to bring the world to Penn and Penn to the world even stronger.\u201d Then a U.S. senator, Biden speaks in February 1990 to a group of attendees at a Wharton Health Care Management Program symposium on substance abuse. (Image: University Archives) Across the board, students, faculty, and staff alike took note of Biden\u2019s call for collaboration. He would often say, as he still does today: \u201c All politics are personal .\u201d \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s distinguished career of service has been guided by his unique capacity to bring people together to make progress, an attribute our country needs now more than ever,\u201d says Penn Provost Wendell Pritchett . \u201cHe made a point of emphasizing this quality to Penn students when he spoke to them.\u201d Pritchett adds that Biden often conversed with the Penn community at tipping points, \u201cwhen their faith was shaken,\u201d by the actions of our leaders, of our institutions, of our democracy, and of our fellow Americans. \u201cBiden would encourage them to engage rather than turn away,\u201d Pritchett recalls. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me the American people can\u2019t handle this,\u201d Biden told students in 2017 . \u201cThis is not a time to be down, this is a time to jump in.\u201d Clockwise from top left: Biden engaging with students in the Friars Senior Society; Biden on stage in discussion with Felipe Calder\u00f3n; Biden on stage with Jeb Bush during the 2018 Silfen Forum on immigration; and Biden, President Amy Gutmann, and David Cohen, chair of the Penn Board of Trustees, at"}], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 4, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.4}

Within minutes, the Biden campaign was selling fly swatters, branded with the Biden-Harris logo, and they sold out overnight. Nearly 35,000 units have been sold, according to the Biden campaign. The campaign first capitalized on the fly moment by making a meme out of it, with Biden's account tweeting a photo of the former vice president with a fly swatter. \"Pitch in $5 to help this campaign fly,\" the tweet read. Biden's account then tweeted a link to flywillvote.com. The website redirects users to iwillvote.com, a voter registration site paid for by the Democratic National Committee where people can check if they're registered, request a mail-in ballot and learn more about voting.

{"claim": "The Democrats want to shut down U.S. churches permanently.", "label": "Refuted", "result": {"response": "To assess the factual accuracy of the statement \"The Democrats want to shut down U.S. churches permanently,\" we need to analyze the claim in light of the provided knowledge points.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The statement suggests that the Democratic Party has a goal or intention to permanently close all churches in the United States. This is a significant assertion that implies a broad and extreme policy position.\n\n2. **Political Context**: Historically, the Democratic Party has advocated for the separation of church and state and has supported policies that promote religious freedom. While there may be individual Democrats who hold varying views on the role of religion in public life, the party as a whole does not have a platform that includes shutting down churches.\n\n3. **Religious Freedom**: The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion, which includes the right to operate churches. Any attempt to shut down churches would likely face significant legal challenges and public opposition, regardless of the political party in power.\n\n4. **Current Political Climate**: There have been discussions and debates about the role of churches during events like the COVID-19 pandemic, where some restrictions were placed on gatherings, including those in religious settings. However, these measures were typically framed as public health responses rather than an intention to permanently close churches.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the above points, the claim that \"The Democrats want to shut down U.S. churches permanently\" lacks factual support. It misrepresents the party's stance on religious freedom and does not reflect any official policy or widespread intention among Democrats.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the statement is determined to be false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 0, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.4}

But the loosely organized movement of left-wing activists has become a favorite right-wing boogeyman and frequent target for President Donald Trump, especially as racial justice protests gained steam over the summer and in Portland. As the wildfires raged in Oregon, and the rest of the West Coast, this conspiracy about antifa morphed into a new and dangerous form. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement \u201cJust like some of the conspiracy theories are manifesting in the real world as anti-mask protests,\u201d says Kate Starbird, a researcher with the University of Washington who has tracked the explosion of online disinformation about COVID-19, \u201chere they\u2019re manifesting as roadblocks and people threatening others with guns.\u201d After sharing versions of the antifa arson conspiracy multiple times, Friends of Science retweeted other mentions of arson in the Pacific Northwest, even minor ones. An intentional brush fire that\u2019s quickly extinguished or a fire at the site of the Portland protests somehow becomes a way to dismiss the entire climate crisis. As misinformation researcher Claire Wardle points out , \u201cThe most effective disinformation has always been that which has a kernel of truth to it.\u201d Another issue likely at play here is confirmation bias\u2014the tendency for people to accept new information that confirms their existing beliefs and worldviews. That bias could leave some people susceptible to alternative explanations, like Trump blaming poor land management for the fires\u2019 severity\u2014a strategy that has been convincing for many on the right . And as people go through a process that Starbird describes as \u201ccollective sense-making,\u201d they search for evidence that explains the crisis they are enduring. \u201cIf there are two competing theories emerging from the sense-making process,\u201d says Starbird, \u201cpeople might be more drawn to the ones that align with their preexisting beliefs.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement Given that climate deniers are more likely to ascribe to conspiracy theories in general, reject expert knowledge, and distrust institutions, it\u2019s easier to understand their embrace of the ideas that scientists are duping the public over human-caused climate change or that left-wing arsonists are at work in Oregon\u2019s fires. \u201cIf the scientific community says human-caused global warming is exacerbating wildfires, how do you explain that?\u201d says George Mason University climate communication researcher John Cook. \u201cThey\u2019re either all wrong in the same direction accidentally, or they\u2019re all colluding to deceive us.

It allows for abortions to be performed up to 20 weeks of pregnancy without the need for a medical certificate. After 20 weeks, abortions can be performed if there are serious health risks to the mother or fetus.\n\n2. **Controversial Abortion Methods**: The term \"controversial abortion methods\" can refer to various procedures that may be debated in terms of ethics, safety, or societal acceptance. However, the Act itself does not specify which methods are considered controversial. It primarily focuses on the legal framework for accessing abortion services.\n\n3. **Legislative Intent**: The intent of the legislation was to ensure that women have the right to make decisions about their own bodies and to provide safe and legal access to abortion services. This suggests that the legislation aims to reduce stigma and increase access rather than endorse or prohibit specific methods.\n\n4. **Public and Political Discourse**: While there may be public and political debates surrounding certain abortion methods, the Act itself does not explicitly categorize any methods as controversial or illegal. \n\nBased on the above points, the statement that \"controversial abortion methods are allowed under New Zealand's Abortion Legislation Act (2020)\" can be interpreted as true in the sense that the Act does not prohibit any specific methods, including those that may be considered controversial. However, it is important to note that the Act does not explicitly endorse any controversial methods either.\n\nGiven this analysis, the conclusion is that the statement is accurate in the context of the legislation allowing for various methods of abortion without specific prohibitions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"True\"\n}\n```", "answer": "True"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "Our assessment: Vaccination requirements 8.6 Controversy over compulsory measures 8.7 What we learned looking back 8.8 Lessons - Endnotes 9.1 Taking stock 9.2 The story of the response 9.3 Moving on Part Three: Moving Forward 10.1 Lessons for the future 10.2 The context for our lessons for the future 10.3 Lessons for the future 10.4 Endnotes 11.1 Recommendations 11.2 Introduction 11.3 In brief: what the recommendations say 11.4 Complete table of recommendations Appendices A: An overview of legislation, emergency plans, systems and structures supporting the COVID-19 response A.1 Legislation A.2 Emergency plans A.3 All-of-government systems and structures A.4 Human rights frameworks A.5 Endnotes B: An epidemiological overview of COVID-19 in Aotearoa New Zealand B.1 Introduction B.2 Data and methods B.3 Cases, hospitalisations and deaths across 2020 to 2022 B.4 Stringency of public health and social measures B.5 Vaccination rates B.6 Additional COVID-19 deaths and YLLs had New Zealand not pursued an elimination strategy, or not vaccinated B.7 Close ups of 2020 and 2021: cases and hospitalisations, alert levels and key policy events B.8 Case, hospitalisation and death rates by socio-demographic groups B.9 Endnotes C: Pandemic scenarios C.1 Purpose and audience C.2 Generic or \u2018Agent X\u2019 pandemic scenarios C.3 Examples of future pandemic scenarios C.4 Endnotes D: Vaccine coverage and population immunity \u2013 key considerations for lifting pandemic measures D.1 Purpose D.2 What do we mean by population immunity?

These were to support the public health response by maintaining economic activity, sustaining business confidence, protecting employment, protecting incomes, sustaining financial stability, and ensuring that all essential services were accessible. A 2021 OECD report indicated that, in doing so (initially at least), Aotearoa New Zealand had generated better economic and social outcomes than most other OECD countries. Initially, the Reserve Bank and the Treasury were also concerned that the health crisis could develop into a financial crisis. This too was successfully avoided. Moreover, it had achieved these outcomes with restrictions that were of comparatively short duration and, over the course of the pandemic, less stringent on average than in many\nher death. Other similarly tragic stories are sure to emerge once state review committees begin to publicize their findings, which operate with a lag. MYTH #4: Depending on who is elected, there will be a federal law either banning or legalizing abortion nationwide. REALITY : It is highly unlikely the election will change the composition of Congress enough to give either party sufficient votes to pass a federal law either banning or legalizing abortion nationwide. Vice President Harris has consistently supported abortion rights over the course of her political career . As the Democratic presidential nominee, Harris has said she supports legislation that would restore the protections established by Roe v. Wade . She has not answered the question about whether she opposes any restrictions on abortion. Under Roe v. Wade , states could only restrict abortion after the point of fetal viability, or about 22 weeks of pregnancy, except in cases where abortions were necessary to protect the life or health of the pregnant person. Former President Trump\u2019s position on a national abortion ban has wavered significantly over time. As president, Trump supported a 2018 bill that would have banned abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy nationwide. Earlier this year, Trump signaled support for a 16-week and then a 15-week abortion ban. His current position is that the legality of abortion should be left to the states. During the presidential debate against Vice President Harris, Trump declined to say whether he would veto a national ban if he were reelected. To enact legislation that would protect or ban abortion nationwide, the party that won the presidency would also need to secure majorities in both the House and Senate. All three are shaping up to be tight races. Because it is highly unlikely either party will secure sufficient support in this election, including the 60 votes needed to overcome the Senate filibuster , neither will be able to pass a federal law codifying abortion policy nationwide. This means those in favor of protecting reproductive rights need to do so through the kind of measures that will be on the ballot in many states. MYTH #5: Women living in states where abortion is legal will not be affected by the outcome of the 2024 election. REALITY: Federal regulation, largely determined by executive agencies operating under the authority of the president, plays a major role in determining access to abortion. In recent\nof abortion policy in their state (45%), how to obtain an abortion if they need one in the near future (26%), or that people in their state can get medication abortion pills online (19%). Since Roe v. Wade was overturned, the landscape involving abortion bans and restrictions at the state level has been shifting rapidly. The survey also explores the abortion experiences and perspectives of women in Florida \u2014where it is on the ballot this November\u2014and Arizona , a swing state that may have an abortion ballot initiative this fall. Nearly one in five (18%) reproductive-age women in Florida report they have had an abortion. Among women of reproductive-age in Arizona, 15% say they have had an abortion at some point in their lives. Seven in 10 women in Arizona (70%) and Florida (72%) say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Additional findings include: In Florida, only one in five (18%) are aware medication abortion is still legal in their state (abortion is available until six weeks in Florida). About a third (34%) don\u2019t know where to get an abortion or where to find the information should they need one, and only one in ten (9%) are aware that medication abortion pills can be obtained online. Awareness is similarly limited in Arizona (where abortion is currently available up to 15 weeks), particularly among women with lower incomes who are affected disproportionately by restrictions on abortion, have lower awareness about abortion access in their state, and have more significant concerns about pregnancy safety. The fallout from the overturning of Roe v. Wade has resulted in a substantial number of women who report struggling themselves\u2014or knowing someone who struggled\u2014to get an abortion. Nearly one in ten (8%) women of reproductive age in the United States personally know someone, including themselves, who has had difficulty getting an abortion since Roe v. Wade was overturned, including 11% of Hispanic women and 13% of women living in states with abortion bans. Among the barriers cited were traveling out of state for care, not knowing where to go, and lacking the money to cover the cost. Across the United States, 17% of reproductive-age women report changing their contraceptive practices as a result of Roe v. Wade being overturned. Actions taken include starting birth control, getting a sterilization procedure, switching to a more effective method, or purchasing emergency contraceptive pills to have on hand.\nbecoming pregnant and increased access to contraception rather than by laws restricting abortions, said Elizabeth Nash, the institute\u2019s senior state policy manager. \"Between 2011 and 2017, the abortion decline appears to be driven by fewer people becoming pregnant in the first place, as both abortions and births declined. If abortion restrictions were the main driver across the board, we\u2019d expect the birth rate to increase,\" Nash said. \"There are a lot of potential factors at play, including increased access to affordable contraception (due to the Affordable Care Act among other policies that make it easier to afford contraception), new methods of contraception, and changing pregnancy desires and attitudes.\" Our ruling A Facebook post shares a graph on U.S. abortion rates and says the larger declines during recent Democratic presidential administrations is due to the party\u2019s approach of making abortions unnecessary, rather than the Repbulican party\u2019s approach of making them illegal. The graphs cites CDC data, but health department reporting on abortions has fluctuated so much over the years that making broad comparisons can prove challenging. Not every state has reported its abortion data for every year. Moreover, experts said tying the abortion rate to the occupant of the White House alone is an oversimplification of a variety of factors that are at play. We rate this claim Half True.

(In this article , Care Net addresses the \u201ccontraception mentality\u201d of Planned Parenthood.) This is helpful information from Abort73 : Is contraception really the best way to prevent abortion? Would there actually be more abortions if Planned Parenthood didn't exist? After all, Planned Parenthood declares on its website that it prevents 560,000 unintended pregnancies a year, and the Guttmacher Institute tells us that 40% of unintended pregnancies are aborted. Do we say then that Planned Parenthood is preventing a quarter-million abortions each year? We certainly do not! These are hypothetical saves; they pale in comparison to the millions of living human beings who've already been torn to pieces by Planned Parenthood. In a 2010 report examining contraceptive use in the United States over the last 30 years, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reaches this conclusion: Contraceptive use in the United States is virtually universal among women of reproductive age\u2026 But that does not mean that contraceptive use in the United States is completely consistent or effective. One-half of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended, and the average probability of an unintended pregnancy in 12 months of contraceptive use in the United States is 12%, unchanged from 1995. Ann Furedi, the chief executive of the largest independent abortion provider in the UK, had this to say about birth control in a 2008 London debate : \u201cWe live in a society where we know contraception fails. In the real world, out of women who are using the pill well, about 8 in every 100 will get pregnant in the course of a year.\u201d The World Health Organization (WHO) adds the following: \u201cEven if all contraceptive users were to use methods perfectly all the time, there would still be nearly six million accidental pregnancies annually. Thus, even with high rates of contraceptive use, (millions of) unwanted pregnancies will occur.\u201d This is the dirty little secret of birth control. It only works most of the time . What does that mean on the average university campus? Consider the University of Minnesota. In 2007, the UM Boynton Health Service surveyed 10,000 college students throughout the state . Seventy-two percent indicated they were sexually active during the last year.

[ 6 ] Worker and traveler mandates Private mandates As of July 2021, vaccination mandates have largely been enforced by means of employers, including private businesses and governmental divisions, [ 7 ] [ 8 ] while some private businesses such as restaurants and event promoters may also decline to serve customers if they do not present proof of vaccination . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] In August 2021, several cities announced plans to require proof of vaccination for patrons of certain types of non-essential indoor venues. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] In some cases, provisions that are described as a vaccine mandate are officially termed as a constraint requiring those who are not fully-vaccinated for COVID-19 to undergo regular testing\u2014thus allowing for medical or religious exemptions to be fulfilled when needed. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] In June 2021, the initial EUA status of the vaccines led to challenges as to whether such mandates were legal, [ 17 ] as FDA regulations state that a person must be informed \"of the option to accept or refuse administration of the product, of the consequences, if any, of refusing administration of the product, and of the alternatives to the product that are available and of their benefits and risks\". As these regulations refer to an \"option to accept or refuse\", some opponents of vaccination initially questioned whether a vaccine issued under EUA can be mandated as a vaccination policy . [ 18 ] [ 19 ] However, courts addressing the issue uniformly held that such mandates were permissible, with the court in Klaassen v. Indiana University in particular addressing this subject at length. In May 2021, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued guidance stating that employers can require their employees to be vaccinated, unless covered by an exemption under the Americans with Disabilities Act (medical exemptions) or Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (religious\noutbreaks involving unvaccinated players if they cannot be made up during the regular season (which will count as a loss by forfeit , and require the team to pay financial compensation to the opposing team). [ 29 ] [ 30 ] In mid-August 2021, Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) and Live Nation Entertainment both announced that they will mandate vaccination at their venues (where legally possible) in October 2021, with AEG requiring all attendees, staff and performers to be vaccinated with no exceptions effective October 1, and Live Nation requiring attendees to be vaccinated or have recently tested negative for COVID-19 effective October 4. [ 11 ] Federal mandates Main article: Biden administration COVID-19 action plan In September 2021, Biden announced the Biden administration COVID-19 action plan , a six-point plan of new measures to help control the pandemic, which included new executive orders and regulatory actions to effectively mandate vaccination for COVID-19 among a large swath of the American workforce. Executive orders were announced directing all federal agencies to mandate the vaccination of their employees (with exceptions as required by law, and no option for regular testing in lieu of vaccination) [ 31 ] per guidance to be developed by the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force, and all future government contracts to include a clause requiring compliance with guidance to be developed by the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force (likely to include a similar mandate). [ 31 ] The administration set a November 22, 2021 deadline for most federal employees to be fully vaccinated and a January 4, 2022 deadline for federal contractors to be vaccinated. [ 32 ] In September 2021, the employees of all federally-funded Medicaid and Medicare -certified health care facilities, and Head Start program facilities, were required to be vaccinated, as ordered through the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 31 ] Companies with more than 100 employees could either require vaccination for all (and give their workers four hours' paid time off for their vaccination appointments); or require any unvaccinated employees to wear masks and be tested weekly for COVID-19, according to an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Emergency Temporary Standard. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] These two policies together \u2014federally-funded healthcare facilities and large companies\u2014 would apply to 100 million workers and were scheduled to take effect on January 4, 2022.

[ 30 ] A lesion was removed at that time. Biden had radiation and chemotherapy treatments and the cancer remained stable. On May 20, 2015, he was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, because of a recurrence of brain cancer. He died there ten days later, on May 30, 2015, at the age of 46. [ 31 ] His funeral was held at St. Anthony of Padua Roman Catholic Church in Wilmington, Delaware , on June 6, 2015.

Along with his mother and siblings, he was in the 1972 crash, sustaining injuries to his skull. Along with his older brother, he survived after receiving months of medical treatment. Like his father and brother, Hunter attended Archmere Academy in Claymont, Delaware . He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Georgetown University in 1992. During the year after he graduated from college, he served as a Jesuit volunteer at a church in Portland, Oregon , and met Kathleen Buhle , whom he married in 1993. After attending Georgetown University Law Center for one year, he transferred to Yale Law School and graduated in 1996. [ 33 ] He and Kathleen divorced in 2017 and, in 2019, he married Melissa Cohen. After law school, Hunter accepted a position at bank holding company MBNA America, a major contributor to his father's political campaigns. By 1998, Biden had risen to the rank of executive vice president.

In his 2021 memoir, Hunter said he felt the unresolved trauma both he and his brother dealt with after the accident in 1972 \u201cmanifested themselves differently in each of us,\u201d for the rest of their lives. To blame it for his own substance abuse battles would be a \u201ccop-out,\u201d he wrote, but added later that it took him decades \u201cto acknowledge that original loss, address that original trauma, recognize that original pain.\u201d Reflecting on grief recently in an interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, Joe Biden said that as difficult as losing Beau was for him, it \u201cwas even more profound for Hunter\u201d and his daughter, Ashley. \u201cIt made me a little more fatalistic. It also caused me and Jill enormous pain because he should be the one sitting there talking to you, Beau. He was a better man than I am, and so is Hunter,\u201d Joe Biden said. Hunter, in his book, wrote that he and his father initially \u201cdealt with our grief in ways that often were incongruent with helping each other.\u201d His father immersed himself in his work, as vice president and then in the run-up to his 2020 campaign, but ultimately the attacks on him in that campaign helped bring them together again. \u201cWhenever I apologized to him for bringing so much heat onto his campaign, he responded by saying how sorry he was for putting me on the spot, for bringing so much heat onto me, especially at a time when I was so determined to get well,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest political debate my dad and I had for months: Who should apologize to whom?\u201d The wrecked car of Neilia Biden, 1972.

Hunter Biden \u201ccomes up all the time,\u201d one source who has spoken with the president said, sometimes out of concern but also with pride at how he has endured the harsh spotlight recently. Not everyone in the West Wing, even at senior levels, knew what Hunter Biden would say Wednesday. But the president, who speaks with his son most days, if not multiple times each day, knew. And sources close to the president quickly praised the remarks as \u201cpowerful\u201d and \u201cforceful.\u201d Republicans have made \u201cwhere\u2019s Hunter\u201d a calling card of the 2024 race, with merchandise bearing the slogan. Biden advisers have noted, though, that Hunter Biden was also a target in the 2020 race and said the president\u2019s critics often miss that the president\u2019s standing by his son, especially supporting him in his recovery, has often made those attacks backfire.

Firearms-related fatalities claimed the lives of 52 officers in 2018, a 13 percent increase compared to the 46 officers killed in firearms-related incidents in 2017. Of the 52 officer deaths, 14 occurred while officers were attempting to place an individual under arrest. Eight officers were killed while conducting an investigative activity. Six officers were killed responding to domestic disturbance and public disturbance calls, each totaling 12. Five officers were ambushed in 2018, a 50 percent decrease over 2017.

Two officers were inadvertently shot by other law enforcement personnel. One officer was killed while responding to a burglary; one was killed during a tactical situation and one was killed while responding to a call for an armed suicidal suspect. Handguns were the leading type of firearm used against law enforcement in 2018. Of the 52 officer fatalities, 31 officers were shot and killed with a handgun; four were disarmed and shot with their own duty weapons. Traffic-related fatalities increased nine percent from 2017 with 50 officer deaths. Of those, 32 officers were killed in crashes. Fourteen officers were struck while outside of their vehicle, a 56 percent increase over the nine officers struck and killed in 2017. Four officers were killed in motorcycle crashes.

Our country has experienced both the good and the bad times in its 65 years of nationhood, as is normal for every nation and its people. We fought a bitter and avoidable civil war, experienced military dictatorships, and lived through major political crises. In all these, we weathered every storm and overcame every challenge with courage, grit, and uncommon determination. While our system and ties that bind us are sometimes stretched by insidious forces opposed to our values and ways of life, we continue to strive to build a more perfect union where every Nigerian can find better accommodation and find purpose and fulfilment. 6. Fellow Compatriots, this is the third time I will address you on our independence anniversary since I assumed office as your President on May 29, 2023. In the last 28 months of my administration, like our founding fathers and leaders who came before me, I have committed myself irrevocably to the unfinished nation-building business. 7. Upon assuming office, our administration inherited a near-collapsed economy caused by decades of fiscal policy distortions and misalignment that had impaired real growth. As a new administration, we faced a simple choice: continue business as usual and watch our nation drift, or embark on a courageous, fundamental reform path. We chose the path of reform. We chose the path of tomorrow over the comfort of today. Less than three years later, the seeds of those difficult but necessary decisions are bearing fruit. 8. In resetting our country for sustainable growth, we ended the corrupt fuel subsidies and multiple foreign exchange rates that created massive incentives for a rentier economy, benefiting only a tiny minority. At the same time, the masses received little or nothing from our Commonwealth. Our administration has redirected the economy towards a more inclusive path, channelling money to fund education, healthcare, national security, agriculture, and critical economic infrastructure, such as roads, power, broadband, and social investment programmes. These initiatives will generally improve Nigerians\u2019 quality of life. As a result of the tough decisions we made, the Federal and State governments, including Local Governments, now have more resources to take care of the people at the lower level of the ladder, to address our development challenges. 9. Fellow Nigerians, we are racing against time.

It was part of the Force Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (FCIID), headed by the then Deputy Inspector General of Police Anthony Ogbizi . [ 1 ] SARS was controversial for its links to extrajudicial killings , forced disappearances , extortion , torture , framing , blackmail , kidnapping , illegal organ trade , armed robbery , home invasions , rape of men and women, child arrests, the invasion of privacy , and polluting bodies of water with the illegal disposal of human remains. SARS was investigated several times in response to protests, but without results; reforms were promised in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] The unit was disbanded on 11 October 2020 after worldwide protests under the motto \" End SARS \" occurred. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] History [ edit ] The Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) was founded in late 1992 by former police commissioner Simeon Danladi Midenda . The inciting events that spurred SARS formation were the killing of Colonel Ezra Dindam Rimdan ( Nigerian Army ) by police officers at a checkpoint in Lagos in September 1992, their arrest, [ 6 ] a strike by police officers in response, and a subsequent crime wave. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] When the information about Rimdan's death and the police's complicity reached the army, soldiers were dispatched into the\nof the Congo Republic of the Congo Djibouti Egypt Equatorial Guinea Eritrea Eswatini Ethiopia Gabon The Gambia Ghana Guinea Guinea-Bissau Ivory Coast Kenya Lesotho Liberia Libya Madagascar Malawi Mali Mauritania Mauritius Morocco Mozambique Namibia Niger Nigeria Rwanda S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe Senegal Seychelles Sierra Leone Somalia South Africa South Sudan Sudan Tanzania Togo Tunisia Uganda Zambia Zimbabwe States with limited recognition Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic Somaliland Dependencies and other territories Canary Islands / Ceuta / Melilla (Spain) Madeira (Portugal) Mayotte / R\u00e9union (France) Saint Helena / Ascension Island / Tristan da Cunha (United Kingdom) This Nigeria -related article is a stub .

{"claim": "The number of North American bison has been reduced to only twenty-seven individuals due to colonizers.", "label": "Refuted", "result": {"response": "To assess the factual accuracy of the statement, let's break it down step-by-step using the provided knowledge points.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statement**: The statement claims that the number of North American bison has been reduced to only twenty-seven individuals due to colonizers.\n\n2. **Key Points from Knowledge**:\n   - North American bison, also known as buffalo, were once abundant across the continent.\n   - The population of bison drastically declined in the 19th century due to overhunting and habitat loss, largely attributed to European colonization and expansion.\n   - At one point, the population was reduced to a critically low number, but it is historically documented that the population fell to a few hundred individuals, not just twenty-seven.\n   - Conservation efforts have since helped to increase the bison population, and there are now several hundred thousand bison in North America, although they are not all in the wild.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Claim**: The statement's claim that the number of North American bison was reduced to only twenty-seven individuals is an exaggeration. While the population did reach critically low levels, it is not accurate to state that it was reduced to just twenty-seven. Historical records indicate that the population was much lower than its original numbers but not as low as twenty-seven.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the historical context and the actual numbers involved, the statement is factually incorrect.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 0, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.4}
{"claim": "U.S. President Donald Trump has suspended all travel from China.", "label": "Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking", "result": {"response": "To assess the factual accuracy of the statement \"U.S. President Donald Trump has suspended all travel from China,\" we need to analyze the relevant knowledge points provided.\n\n1. **Travel Restrictions**: The knowledge indicates that Trump imposed travel restrictions on certain foreign nationals who had been in China, Europe\u2019s Schengen area, the UK, or Ireland within the past 14 days. However, it also mentions that there were exemptions for certain groups, including U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and their close family members.\n\n2. **Nature of the Ban**: The statement claims that Trump \"suspended all travel from China.\" However, the knowledge clarifies that the restrictions were not absolute and did not apply to all individuals. U.S. citizens and permanent residents were exempt from the travel ban.\n\n3. **Context of the Statement**: The knowledge points out that Trump often describes the restrictions as a \"ban\" without elaborating on the exemptions, which could lead to misunderstandings about the nature of the travel restrictions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement is misleading because it implies a complete suspension of travel from China, which is not accurate given the exemptions that were in place.\n\nThus, the conclusion is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "China contained exemptions for certain people \u2013 he usually just describes it as a \u201cban\u201d without elaboration \u2013 he still wasn\u2019t telling the full story.

Biden and the restrictions on China During the meeting with DeSantis, Trump repeated his false claim that Biden had apologized for previous criticism of Trump\u2019s travel restrictions on China. \u201cHe said all sorts of things, we won\u2019t even say it. And then he apologized because \u2013 two weeks ago he put out a statement that I was right,\u201d Trump said . Facts First: Biden\u2019s campaign announced in early April that he supports Trump\u2019s travel restrictions on China, so part of Trump\u2019s claim is correct. But neither Biden nor his campaign apologized for any previous criticism of Trump. The campaign says that the Biden comments Trump has described as criticism of the China restrictions \u2013 in which Biden said Trump has a record of \u201chysterical xenophobia\u201d and \u201cfear mongering\u201d \u2013 were not about the travel restrictions at all. The campaign says Biden did not know about the China restrictions at the time of the January 31 speech in which he made these remarks, since his campaign event in Iowa started shortly after the briefing during which the China restrictions were revealed by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. Given the timing of the Biden remarks, it\u2019s not unreasonable for the Trump campaign to infer that Biden was talking about the travel restrictions. But Biden never took an explicit position on the restrictions until his April declaration of support \u2013 and whether or not you accept his campaign\u2019s argument that the \u201cxenophobia\u201d claim was not about the restrictions, he certainly hasn\u2019t apologized.

On Sept. 1, Trump imposed a 15% tariff for the first time on finished consumer goods imported from China, including clothing, shoes, appliances and food. A similar tariff is due to go into effect Dec. 15 on a deeper set of consumer goods, including electronics and smartphones. At that point, the average tariff would have risen to 24.3% and Trump would have hiked taxes on virtually everything imported from China. An \u2018escalation\u2019 scenario China has done the same to American exports, and simply refused to buy some American products, such as agricultural goods. Negotiators will restart trade talks soon, but many analysts are skeptical of a deal between two egocentric presidents insistent on saving face. \u201cWe remain skeptical that [Chinese President] Xi will be willing to accept any deal, even one that is limited in scope, with Trump going forward,\u201d Beacon Policy Advisors told clients recently. Story Continues U.S. President Donald Trump holds a campaign rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina, U.S., September 9, 2019. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque Trump is in denial, if his public comments are any indication. He says repeatedly, and falsely, that China is paying the tariffs, rather than Americans. He says the economy is doing great even though it\u2019s clearly slowing down . Growth is only around 1.6% at the moment, and it could slow to 1% or worse by the end of the year. Nobody knows where the trade war is headed. Moody\u2019s Analytics examined an \u201cescalation\u201d scenario with even higher tariffs and other trade hostilities between China and the United States. The Federal Reserve tries to intervene by rapidly cutting interest rates to zero, but there\u2019s still a deep recession in the U.S. and Europe. In a de-escalation scenario, Trump makes a deal with China by the end of 2019 and gradually removes the existing tariffs. The economy stabilizes and stocks rally. Many investors assume Trump has no choice but to hammer out a trade deal with China, because his reelection depends on it. But many of those same investors thought there\u2019d be a trade deal by now, and never foresaw Trump going as far as taxing consumer imports. The key factor may be whether Trump believes his own fictitious spin, or can actually see the harm his trade war is causing.

A more permissive environment for Chinese aggression and suppression Throughout this period, President Trump made efforts to develop a smooth and positive relationship with China \u2014 and especially with Xi Jinping \u2014 and explained his efforts as serving the purpose of advancing trade negotiations. Trump lauded Xi\u2019s strength and leadership publicly while shying away from points of sharp bilateral friction in private engagements. Instead, Trump reportedly used his private exchanges with Xi to urge him to act on his personal priorities, most of which related to the trade negotiations, and, for a time, North Korea. In June 2019, Trump reportedly promised Xi Jinping in a private phone call that the United States would refrain from criticizing China over Hong Kong while trade negotiations were ongoing. The following month, Trump said he believed that Xi Jinping had acted \u201cvery responsibly\u201d with the protests in Hong Kong , adding, \u201cWe\u2019re working on trade deals right now. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d He expressed similar sentiments publicly in November when he shied away from criticizing Xi about Hong Kong and linked the issue to trade negotiations , saying, \u201cWe have to stand with Hong Kong, but I\u2019m also standing with President Xi.\u201d He further said that Xi is \u201ca friend of mine, he\u2019s an incredible guy,\u201d and described the Hong Kong protests as a \u201ccomplicating factor\u201d in trade talks. On January 10, 2020, when Laura Ingraham on Fox News asked Trump about \u201cthe human rights issue in China\u201d and referenced \u201ca million people in reeducation camps, internment camps,\u201d he replied , \u201cWell, I\u2019m riding a fine line, because we\u2019re making\u2026great trade deals.\u201d John Bolton, then national security adviser, claims that the reasons behind President Trump\u2019s prioritization of a trade deal above other considerations with China were made clear in a private meeting with Xi Jinping at the June 2019 G-20 summit in Japan. According to Bolton , Trump told Xi to go ahead with building camps to detain 1 million or more Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, saying it was exactly the right thing to do, and asked Xi Jinping to help him win the upcoming presidential election by increasing purchases of soybeans and wheat. Trump later challenged Bolton\u2019s characterization of events, tweeting that Bolton\u2019s book \u201cis a compilation of lies and made up stories\u201d; Trump specifically denied Bolton\u2019s claims\nTimeline of Trump\u2019s Coronavirus Responses | Congressman Lloyd Doggett Skip to main content Timeline of Trump\u2019s Coronavirus Responses March 2, 2022 Blog Post Image May 2018 The Trump Administration disbands the White House pandemic response team.

The U.S. has accused the company of conspiring to steal trade secrets and said its technology could be used for Chinese espionage. Huawei has denied this. On May 15, the Trump administration announced measures designed to prevent foreign companies that use U.S. software and technology from providing chips to the company. Those sanctions could delay the rollout of the company\u2019s 5G technology, its chief technology officer told Yahoo Finance. Still, some experts told the Wall Street Journal that loopholes remain that may allow supplies to flow to the company in more indirect ways.

But Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg last week said Conservatives did not need to do so because they knew each other well, and this meant they were complying with government guidance. And he claimed Labour MPs only wore masks when the television cameras were around. The latest official guidance says people in England should cover their faces around \"people you don't normally meet\". It comes as the World Health Organisation (WHO) urged MPs to wear masks during Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget speech, when there is likely to be standing room only in the Commons chamber. Dr David Nabarro, the WHO's special envoy for Covid-19, told Sky News that \"everybody\" should be wearing masks in close confinement with other people, \"including our leaders\". \"This virus, it is absolutely unstoppable, it gets everywhere, and so we have to do everything we possibly can to stop it. \"And one of the best ways to stop it is a well-fitting surgical mask properly over your face, pushed in over your nose, covering everything, and that reduces the risk to others and the risk to you. \"If it works, why on earth don't people use it? It's not a party political issue - this virus doesn't vote.\" Garry Graham, deputy general secretary of the union Prospect, said the public looked to MPs to set an example. \"It's welcome that House authorities are finally catching on to what unions have been saying, that it's too early to relax. But we're still left in the ludicrous situation where MPs do as they please on masks while everyone else does the right thing,\" he said. \"Continuously changing an already inconsistent message is a recipe for non-compliance and increased risk to everyone.\" House of Commons Chancellor's Autumn Statement Personal protective equipment (PPE)\nCovid: Masks mandatory for everyone in the Commons - except MPs Skip to content Home News US & Canada UK UK Politics England N.

They have been encouraged to do so by Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle - but unions representing Parliamentary workers have urged him to take a tougher line . 'The virus doesn't vote' Most opposition parties, including Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP have decided to cover their faces during debates.

The income estimates in the main sections of this report are based on the concept of money income, which is pretax and does not account for the value of in-kind transfers. Appendix A provides a detailed explanation of how income is measured using the CPS ASEC. Estimates of post-tax income and inequality are included in Appendix B. Income in the United States: 2023 [<1.0 MB] Highlights Real median household income was $80,610 in 2023, a 4.0 percent increase from the 2022 estimate of $77,540 (Figure 1 and Table A-1). This is the first statistically significant annual increase in real median household income since 2019. Real median household incomes increased by 5.4 percent for White households and by 5.7 percent for non-Hispanic White households between 2022 and 2023. There was no significant change in median incomes for Black, Asian, and Hispanic households (Figure 2 and Table A-1). Household income rose throughout the income distribution, increasing 6.7 percent at the 10th percentile and 4.6 percent at the 90th percentile (Table A-3). Income inequality as measured by the Gini index and income percentile ratios was not significantly different between 2022 and 2023 (Figure 3 and Table A-3). Between 2022 and 2023, the number of total workers increased by 2.2 million, or 1.3 percent. The change in the number of full-time, year-round workers was not statistically significant (Figure 5 and Table A-6). Real median earnings for men who worked full-time, year-round increased by 3.0 percent, and real median earnings increased 1.5 percent for women who worked full-time, year-round (Figure 4 and Table A-6). For full-time, year-round workers, the female-to-male earnings ratio in 2023 fell to 82.7 percent from 84.0 percent in 2022 (Figure 6 and Table A-6). This is the first statistically significant annual decrease in the female-to-male earnings ratio since 2003. Tables Income: Table A-1.

Here are a few lessons the average person can take away from it. Henglein and Steets / Getty Images Building Wealth Takes Time First, consider how long it took for Biden to become a millionaire. He began his career in 1968 and likely didn\u2019t reach millionaire status for two decades. It\u2019s a good reminder that building a fortune takes time. Instead of trying to get rich quickly, you\u2019re often better off taking the methodical route. Practically, that means consistently spending less than you earn and allocating savings to smart investments. The most realistic path to wealth for the majority of people is investing in the S&P 500, according to financial experts like Warren Buffet and Mark Cuban . It returns an average of around 10.26% . That can add up to quite a bit throughout your life. For example, say you invest $20,000 into the S&P today. Then, you continue investing $1,000 monthly for the next 30 years. You\u2019d end up with over $2.5 million from just $360,000 in contributions. This shows how time creates wealth when you invest well. SrdjanPav / iStock.com The Power of Resiliency Biden\u2019s story is also a good lesson in the power of resiliency. He\u2019s experienced some of the highest highs that a person can because he never gave up during his lowest lows. For example, Biden lost his wife and daughter just after winning his first Senate election.

But three kinds of evidence point to more than 350,000 deaths* By Christie Aschwanden edited by Josh Fischman Peter Horvath * Editor's Note (1/3/21): The number of COVID deaths in the U.S. is now more than 350,000, as of the beginning of January, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center . A persistent falsehood has been circulating on social media: the number of COVID deaths is much lower than official statistics, and therefore the danger of the disease has been overblown. In August, President Donald Trump retweeted a post claiming that only 6 percent of these reported deaths were actually from COVID-19. (The tweet originated from a follower of the debunked conspiracy fantasy QAnon.) Twitter removed the post for containing false information, but fabrications such as these continue to spread. In September outgoing U.S. Representative Roger Marshall of Kansas\u2014now incoming senator\u2014 complained that Facebook had removed a post in which he claimed that 94 percent of COVID-19 deaths reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u201cwere the result of 2-3 additional serious illnesses and were of advanced age.\u201d Now some facts: Researchers know beyond a doubt that the number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. surpassed a quarter of a million people by November 2020. This number is supported by three lines of evidence, including death certificates. The inaccurate idea that only 6 percent of the deaths were really caused by the coronavirus is \u201ca gross misinterpretation\u201d of how death certificates work, says Robert Anderson, chief mortality statistician at the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.

COVID-19 has killed over 5 million people worldwide in just 2 years. But how do flu and COVID-19 deaths compare in the United States? On average in the United States, as shown in the graph below, people are less like to die from the flu than COVID-19. In this graph , you can see the difference in flu and COVID-19 mortality rates from 2014 to December 2021: COVID-19 Prevention is Also Flu Prevention It\u2019s important to note that when COVID-19 started spreading and the country went on lockdown in March 2020, the same measures that were used to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d stopped the flu entirely. In fact, the CDC stopped tracking flu activity early for the 2019-2020 season because COVID-19 precautions wiped out the flu. The flu was virtually nonexistent for the 2020-2021 season likely because people were wearing masks, staying home more often, and not socializing. Now that flu and COVID-19 are spreading at the same time, flu deaths may sadly rise again. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to get vaccinated, get tested, and wear masks to prevent both viruses. Flu is Still Serious Just because flu mortality is lower than COVID-19 mortality doesn\u2019t mean flu isn\u2019t serious. CDC estimates that flu has resulted in 9 million \u2013 41 million illnesses, 140,000 \u2013 710,000 hospitalizations, and 12,000 \u2013 52,000 deaths annually between 2010 and 2020.

However, the gap between death rates among racial/ethnic groups shrunk from 2022 to 2023. In 2022, the COVID death rate for white Americans was 58.6 per 100,000 compared to 71.0 per 100,000 for Black Americans.

He added that there is more work to be done to close the gap even further, including providing access to health care and insurance for traditionally underserved populations. Brownstein also said he hopes more efforts can be made to reduce deaths from traditional leading causes of death such as\nCOVID-19 and excess mortality in the United States: A county-level analysis | PLOS Medicine Article Authors Metrics Comments Media Coverage Reader Comments Figures Figures Abstract Background Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) excess deaths refer to increases in mortality over what would normally have been expected in the absence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Several prior studies have calculated excess deaths in the United States but were limited to the national or state level, precluding an examination of area-level variation in excess mortality and excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19. In this study, we take advantage of county-level variation in COVID-19 mortality to estimate excess deaths associated with the pandemic and examine how the extent of excess mortality not assigned to COVID-19 varies across subsets of counties defined by sociodemographic and health characteristics. Methods and findings In this ecological, cross-sectional study, we made use of provisional National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) data on direct COVID-19 and all-cause mortality occurring in US counties from January 1 to December 31, 2020 and reported before March 12, 2021. We used data with a 10-week time lag between the final day that deaths occurred and the last day that deaths could be reported to improve the completeness of data. Our sample included 2,096 counties with 20 or more COVID-19 deaths. The total number of residents living in these counties was 319.1 million. On average, the counties were 18.7% Hispanic, 12.7% non-Hispanic Black, and 59.6% non-Hispanic White. A total of 15.9% of the population was older than 65 years. We first modeled the relationship between 2020 all-cause mortality and COVID-19 mortality across all counties and then produced fully stratified models to explore differences in this relationship among strata of sociodemographic and health factors. Overall, we found that for every 100 deaths assigned to COVID-19, 120 all-cause deaths occurred (95% CI, 116 to 124), implying that 17% (95% CI, 14% to 19%) of excess deaths were ascribed to causes of death other than COVID-19 itself. Our stratified models revealed that the percentage of excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19 was substantially higher among counties with lower median household incomes and less formal education, counties with poorer health and more diabetes, and counties in the South and West. Counties with more non-Hispanic Black residents, who were already at high risk of COVID-19 death based on direct counts, also reported higher percentages of excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19.

The Tax Foundation estimated BBBA would raise $1.7 trillion of gross revenue over the next decade: $470 billion from corporate and international tax changes; $516 billion from individual tax changes (excluding changes to the State and Local Tax deduction A tax deduction allows taxpayers to subtract certain deductible expenses and other items to reduce how much of their income is taxed, which reduces how much tax they owe.

Altogether, President Biden is proposing raising revenue by more than $4 trillion primarily from new taxes on U.S. businesses and individuals, exceeding the magnitude of his proposed tax hikes during the 2020 campaign ($3.7 trillion on a gross basis). The gross tax increase would be reduced on a net basis by increases in tax credit s for certain individuals and economic activities.

The budget proposes several new tax increases on high-income individuals and businesses, which combined with the\ncapital gains and dividends. However, all of these tax increases would be limited to households making over $400,000, which is only around 1.5 percent of total households. Biden proposes another $1.8 trillion of taxes on corporations, under our central estimate . Most economists and estimators believe corporate tax burdens are borne by some combination of shareholders, owners of capital, and workers. Since many middle-class households include both workers and shareholders (through pensions and retirement accounts, for example), any increase in corporate taxes would indirectly increase their tax burden, albeit modestly. Based on analyses and estimates of Biden's tax plan published by the Tax Policy Center , Penn Wharton Budget Model , Tax Foundation , and American Enterprise Institute , tax burdens among the bottom 80 percent of households in the income distribution would see a 0.2 to 0.6 percent reduction in after-tax income. For a typical family in the middle of the income distribution, this amounts to $180 to $260 per year. But again, these are indirect tax increases. And they don't include many of the tax cuts proposed by Vice President Biden, which will more than offset the increase for many households. It is important to note that Biden's plans, as we've estimated in The Cost of the Trump and Biden Campaign Plans , fall $5.6 trillion short of being offset. Covering this cost may in fact require new taxes on a broader swath of Americans. But as of now, only a small share of Americans would face a tax increase under Biden's plans.

Repealing step-up in basis will compound this problem and force family-owned businesses to sell a significant portion of their business or go into significant debt to pay their tax liability. Taking away step-up in basis has already been tried and failed. In 1976 congress eliminated stepped-up basis but it was so complicated and unworkable it was restored in 1980. As noted in a July 3, 1979 New York Times article , it was \u201cimpossibly unworkable\u201d: \u201cAlmost immediately, however, the new law touched off a flood of complaints as unfair and impossibly unworkable.

Impose a 20 percent minimum tax on \u201cbillionaires\u201d: $360.8 billion tax increase This tax, called a \u201cbillionaire minimum income tax,\u201d would impose an annual 20 percent tax on taxpayers with income and assets that exceeding $100 million, a $360 billion tax increase. This tax is just the latest attempt by the Democrats to reshape the tax code and pass a tax on unrealized gains. This new tax is similar to the wealth taxes pushed by radical progressives such as Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). It would create a \u201cmark to market\u201d regime that would force Americans to pay taxes every year on the paper gain in the value of assets (i.e. stocks, collectibles, real estate). Currently, taxpayers only pay the capital gains tax when an asset is sold. This makes sense because the asset is illiquid until it is disposed of. This tax on unrealized gains would create a new tax system that requires taxpayers to pay tax on the value of an asset based on the value of these assets on a particular arbitrary date. It would empower the IRS, encourage taxpayers to move assets overseas, and could grow to hit millions of Americans over time. It would also harm the economy, impose retroactive taxation, and has failed everywhere it has been tried before. 5.

Some of the proposals may be familiar, recycled from prior budgets and failed legislative attempts , but some are new, like the proposed tax hikes for Medicare funding . In total, they would add up to almost $4.7 trillion in new taxes targeted at businesses and high-income individuals. The major changes include higher marginal tax rates on corporate, individual, and capital gains income; a complicated new minimum tax on high-net-worth individuals; and increases to Medicare taxes. The negative effects of higher tax rates on saving, investment, and entrepreneurship would have economy-wide repercussions , ultimately harming workers, international competitiveness, and domestic investment. The Biden budget would also expand and create several tax credits, including a three-year extension of the American Rescue Plan Act Child Tax Credit (CTC) through 2025 and a permanent expansion of CTC refundability. The tax credits would offset the $4.7 trillion in gross taxes by about $900 billion, resulting in $3.8 trillion of net tax increases. After about $1 trillion of additional new spending on top of expanded tax credits, the FY2024 Budget would reduce the deficit by $2.8 trillion over the next decade. The Biden budget pays lip service to continuing at least some of the individual income tax cuts included in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) that will expire after 2025, but offers no concrete proposal for doing so. As such, the cost of TCJA extensions is not factored into the budget. Nor is the cost of continuing the temporary expansion of the CTC. Together, such extensions would likely offset the projected deficit reductions.

Lowest activity for influenza: identified as weeks in a given year when, for at least two consecutive weeks, <2% of tests for influenza in those weeks are positive. Week 27 through Week 26 of the following calendar year was used to define a surveillance year in order to capture summer COVID-19 activity as the start of a given season. Lowest activity weeks for ARI were identified as weeks when COVID-19, influenza, and RSV were all identified as having low activity according to their separate thresholds. For each state within a region, the reference periods were used to calculate the values that created the levels (categories) for the 2025-2026 surveillance year. First, we calculated the weekly percentage of ED visits attributed to each pathogen and ARI overall within the identified lowest activity periods. Next, we calculated the mean, M, and standard deviation, S, attributed to each pathogen and ARI overall within the identified lowest activity periods. The mean was considered the baseline value for each state and was used as the top value for the Very Low category. Then, we computed the maximum number of standard deviations above the mean for any observed week over all weeks in the three previous seasons (N = maximum number of standard deviations = ( - M) / S). The maximum number of standard deviations (N) was divided by 4 and multiplied by the standard deviation (S = standard deviation). This value was denoted as D, so D = (N / 4) * S. Using X = percent of ED visits in a week for each pathogen and ARI overall, we classified activity levels as follows: Very Low: X <= M, activity at or below baseline Low: M < X <= M + D Moderate: M + D < X <= M + 2D High: M + 2D < X <= + 3D Very High: M + 3D < X Missouri: Due to data quality issues, Missouri's historical data before MMWR Week 10 of 2025 (March 2-8, 2025) could not be used for computing levels, thus leaving insufficient data.

As cases started to mount, on February 28, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the immunologist who heads up the US Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and some colleagues published a paper predicting that Covid would be about as serious as a bad flu epidemic. Their paper, released by the Institute of Allergy and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and run in the New England Journal of Medicine, stated : \u201c the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%. \u201d In other words, one person in a thousand who gets it badly, dies. Yet, just 11 days later, at a congressional hearing, Dr. Fauci had changed his tune: Covid was now going to be TEN TIMES more lethal than flu and would kill one percent of people. He observed : \u201c The flu has a mortality rate of 0.1 percent. This has a mortality rate of 10 times that. That\u2019s the reason I want to emphasize we have to stay ahead of the game in preventing this .\" If influenza killed 50, Covid was going to kill 500. If influenza killed a million, Covid was going to get 10 million. No wonder Congress, then the world, panicked. Because they were told Covid was going to be 10 times worse than influenza. They could see three million deaths in the US alone, and 70 million around the world. Here\u2019s how one paper, \u201c Public health lessons learned from biases in coronavirus mortality overestimation \u201d, put it : \u201c On March 11, 2020... based on the data available at the time, Congress was informed that the estimated mortality rate for the coronavirus was ten-times higher than for seasonal influenza, which helped launch a campaign of social distancing, organizational and business lockdowns, and shelter-in-place orders. \u201d In healthcare, the US is very much the dog that wags the tail.

{"claim": "Transitioning to 100 per cent renewable electricity generation increase power prices in New Zealand", "label": "Refuted", "result": {"response": "To assess the factual accuracy of the statement \"Transitioning to 100 per cent renewable electricity generation increases power prices in New Zealand,\" we need to analyze the relevant knowledge points provided.\n\n1. **Coal and Gas Usage**: The knowledge indicates that coal consumption in New Zealand declined by 3% from 2018 to 2020, while coal-powered electricity generation increased by 51.6% during the same period. This increase in coal generation was attributed to lower hydroelectric generation and gas supply issues, not directly to a transition to renewable energy.\n\n2. **Impact of the Oil and Gas Exploration Ban**: The knowledge points out that the increase in coal-powered generation was not due to the oil and gas exploration ban, as stated by the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment. This suggests that the transition to renewable energy sources is complex and influenced by various factors, including weather conditions and existing infrastructure.\n\n3. **Future of Coal and Gas**: The report mentions that coal is unlikely to play a significant role in New Zealand's electricity sector for much longer due to the Emissions Trading Scheme and the phasing out of coal by major generators. It also states that gas reserves are expected to be sufficient for intermittent electricity generation for several decades, albeit at a higher cost.\n\n4. **Renewable Energy Costs**: While the statement claims that transitioning to 100% renewable energy increases power prices, the knowledge does not provide direct evidence to support this claim. It suggests that renewable solutions are becoming cheaper and that there is a push towards solar and wind energy as viable alternatives.\n\n5. **Market Adaptation**: The knowledge discusses the need for market adaptation to embrace renewable solutions, indicating that there is a belief that renewable energy can help address energy security and potentially lower costs in the long run.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement that transitioning to 100% renewable electricity generation increases power prices in New Zealand is not directly supported by the provided knowledge. In fact, there are indications that renewable energy could lead to lower costs in the future.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "June 2020 quarter (table 1). As the quarterly figures fluctuate a lot, AAP FactCheck also looked at annual figures. Figures for the year to June 2020 show coal consumption declined by three per cent between 2018 and 2020, from 1,157,243 tonnes to 1,153,579 tonnes. MBIE also reports quarterly on the make-up of New Zealand's electricity generation (table 1). Figures for the year to June show coal-powered electricity generation increased by 51.6 per cent between 2018 and 2020, from 1261GWh to 1912GWh. The figures also show gas-powered electricity generation declined by 10.3 per cent, from 6,354GWh in 2018 to 5,701GWh in 2020. However, MBIE's annual report on the energy sector said the increase in coal-powered generation was due to lower hydro electricity generation as the result of a dry year and maintenance at NZ's largest gas field, which reduced the supply of gas (page 14). \"Electricity generation from coal increased by 43 per cent in 2019,\" the report said. \"This was due to the need for non-renewable generation as a result of less favourable hydrological conditions, and gas outages meaning that there was less gas available for electricity generation use.\" (page 14) The report does not mention that the oil and gas exploration ban has had an impact on the supply of gas. It shows gas production is expected to increase in the near future before steadily declining (page 43, Fig E.7). The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment (PCE) investigated the impact of the government's oil and gas exploration ban and noted that the recent increase in coal-powered generation was \"not because of the ban\" (page 40). It found that, in future, a reduction in gas supply for electricity generation could result in more coal being used as it is currently the cheapest substitute (page 40). But it said \"coal is unlikely to play a role in New Zealand's electricity sector for much longer\" due to the Emissions Trading Scheme and coal being phased out by major generators (page 41). It found New Zealand's remaining gas reserves would probably be sufficient for intermittent electricity generation when hydro dams are low \"for several decades to come, albeit at a higher cost than at present\" (page 39). National Party energy and resources spokesperson Jonathan Young made similar claims about the government's oil and gas exploration ban in September which he later admitted was \"completely wrong\" .

National deputy leader Nicola Willis outlined during the campaign that climate adaptation will be a focus of this government . But it\u2019s not mentioned in the agreements once. By extension, climate adaptation can include market adaptation. That means embracing the change in the winds as renewable solutions become increasingly cheaper, not propping up old ideas in a sunset industry. Further proof the market is hardly free.

Image by AP AAP FactCheck Investigation: Is New Zealand using more coal because of the government's offshore oil and gas exploration ban? The Statement \"The oil and gas exploration ban, what did that do, actually, our coal use has now gone up so now we've got more coal being used instead of natural gas to actually create electricity.\" Judith Collins, National Party leader, September 30, 2020. The Analysis National Party leader Judith Collins says the government's efforts to combat climate change have backfired and New Zealand is using more coal as a result of its offshore oil and gas exploration ban. In April 2018, the Labour-led government announced it would not issue any new permits for offshore oil and gas exploration . The policy became law in February 2019 . During the Newshub Leaders' Debate on September 30, Ms Collins said the policy had resulted in an increase in carbon emissions . (Video mark 1hr, 8min, 30secs). \"The oil and gas exploration ban, what did that do, actually our coal use has now gone up so now we've got more coal being used instead of natural gas to actually create electricity,\" Ms Collins said. AAP FactCheck examined Ms Collins statement that coal use had gone up and more coal is being used to generate electricity instead of gas, as a result of the government's offshore oil and gas exploration ban. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) publishes figures on coal consumption , which do not show an increase in coal consumption after the ban became law. Quarterly MBIE figures show coal consumption declined by 27 per cent between the December 2018 quarter - before the oil and gas exploration ban came into effect - and the June 2020 quarter (table 1). As the quarterly figures fluctuate a lot, AAP FactCheck also looked at annual figures. Figures for the year to June 2020 show coal consumption declined by three per cent between 2018 and 2020, from 1,157,243 tonnes to 1,153,579 tonnes.

However, it does highlight his long-standing commitment to education and his involvement in various educational initiatives, particularly during his time as Vice President and as a presidential candidate.\n\n2. **General Stance on Education**: Historically, Biden has supported public education and has been critical of certain aspects of school choice, particularly when it comes to charter schools and voucher programs that divert funds from public schools. His administration has focused on increasing funding for public schools and addressing educational inequities.\n\n3. **Current Context**: As of the latest information available, Biden has not proposed a complete end to school choice but has emphasized the need for accountability and quality in education options. His administration's focus has been more on strengthening public education rather than eliminating school choice entirely.\n\n4. **Public Statements**: Biden has made statements advocating for equitable access to quality education, which may imply a preference for public schooling over unregulated school choice options. However, this does not equate to a desire to end school choice altogether.\n\nIn summary, while Biden has shown a preference for strengthening public education and ensuring accountability in educational choices, the claim that he wants to \"end school choice\" is an oversimplification and does not accurately reflect his nuanced position on the issue.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "spoke honestly and openly about his views pertaining to any and all of the questions posed to him,\u201d said Penn Political Union Chairman Dan Schweitzer in a 1985 The Daily Pennsylvanian article about one of the then-senator\u2019s visits. \u201cHe didn\u2019t pull any punches and was very candid.\u201d Gutmann, who on behalf of Penn Trustees awarded Biden an honorary degree from Penn in 2013 , and often opened her campus talks with Biden by describing him as \u201cone of our nation\u2019s foremost statesmen,\u201d says having him on campus was always a tremendous prospect for learning and education. \u201cEvery time Joe Biden, who on Wednesday will become our 46th U.S. president, visited campus, he brought forth endless expertise on a wide variety of topics\u2014from international affairs and domestic politics to immigration policy and cancer research, and so much more,\u201d Gutmann says. \u201cIn addition, his unmatched personal connections with global leaders made our mission to bring the world to Penn and Penn to the world even stronger.\u201d Then a U.S. senator, Biden speaks in February 1990 to a group of attendees at a Wharton Health Care Management Program symposium on substance abuse.

However, it also notes that Biden has not vocally supported the Green New Deal itself and has a more moderate approach compared to its aggressive timeline.\n\n2. **Animal Agriculture and Gas-Powered Cars**: The statement claims that the Democratic Party under Biden would \"essentially ban animal agriculture\" and \"eliminate gas-powered cars.\" The knowledge does not support these claims. While Biden's plan emphasizes transitioning to a clean energy economy and includes proposals for electric vehicles, it does not mention a ban on animal agriculture. Instead, it focuses on creating jobs and infrastructure related to clean energy and electric vehicles.\n\n3. **Fracking and Emissions**: The knowledge discusses Biden's position on fracking, indicating that he does not support banning it outright, especially in key states where it is economically significant. This suggests a more nuanced approach rather than an outright ban on traditional energy sources.\n\n4. **Overall Position**: The Democratic Party's climate agenda, as represented by Biden, aims to address climate change through job creation and infrastructure improvements rather than through outright bans on specific industries or practices.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement that the Democratic Party of Joe Biden is pushing the Green New Deal and would ban animal agriculture and eliminate gas-powered cars is misleading. While there is a focus on clean energy and electric vehicles, there is no evidence in the knowledge provided that supports the claims of banning animal agriculture or gas-powered cars.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "Joe Biden unveils his $2T AOC-fueled Green New Deal energy agenda Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden unveiled a $2 trillion energy plan Tuesday with a heavy focus on the Green New Deal agenda being pushed by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the far-left flank of his party. Speaking in Wilmington, Del., Biden promised a \u201cclean energy revolution,\u201d which he said would deliver millions of jobs, as he attacked President Trump for calling climate change a \u201choax.\u201d Biden detailed what he called a pro-union platform that would replace the US government\u2019s car fleet with American-made electric vehicles and includes a pledge to create a \u201ccarbon pollution-free electric sector by the year 2025.\u201d \u201cThere is no more consequential challenge that we must meet in the next decade than the onrushing climate crisis. Left unchecked, it is literally an existential threat to the health of our planet and to our very survival,\u201d said Biden, 77. Biden\u2019s announcement comes as the presidential wannabe courts idols on the left of his party including Bronx-Queens Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the hope that they will support him and steer young voters his way in November. In May, AOC announced she had been selected to co-chair Biden\u2019s climate change panel along with former Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. Photo by OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images The former veep on Tuesday promised to \u201ccreate millions of high-paying union jobs by building a modern infrastructure and a clean energy future\u201d and described his vision of a US covered in 500,000 electric car charging stations and thriving factories producing green products. \u201cWhen Donald Trump thinks about renewable energy, he sees windmills somehow causing cancer . When I think about these windmills, I see American manufacturing, American workers rising to dominate the global markets,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI see steel that will be needed for those windmill platforms, towers and ladders which could be made in small manufacturers,\u201d he said. \u201cI see the union-certified men and women who will manufacture and install.\u201d \u201cI see the ports that will come back to life and the longshoremen and the shipbuilders and the communities they support,\u201d he continued. The Green New Deal introduced by AOC \u2014 which even Democrats trashed \u2014 unanimously failed in a Senate vote last year. In a statement to Reuters after news broke that AOC was joining Biden\u2019s climate change panel, a spokesperson for the Democratic socialist\nbroadly align with an approach advocated by the left-wing of the Democratic party. Firstly, like the Green New Deal, Biden\u2019s plans reframe climate action as a jobs, infrastructure and clean energy stimulus . After three decades of economic elites failing to pitch a carbon tax as a solution to the supposed \u201cmarket failure\u201d of greenhouse gas emissions, Biden has elected to focus instead on economy-wide performance standards as the cutting edge of decarbonization. And while earlier generations of Democrats wanted consumers to foot the bill for that clean energy transition at the gas pump, a position shared by Milton Friedman , Biden takes Keynes and Franklin Roosevelt as his intellectual and political forebears. Perhaps most encouragingly, Biden views the workers, unions and communities of color most impacted by the fossil fuel economy and the potential shift away from it as deserving special attention. In his view, climate action cannot be separated from economic, environmental and social justice. This is, in the broadest strokes, the climate policy gospel according to many progressives. Biden\u2019s plans draw upon the Green New Deal-inflected recommendations issued by the joint taskforce convened by surrogates of the Biden and Bernie Sanders campaigns, including Ocasio-Cortez. They also crib heavily from plans devised by Washington governor Jay Inslee\u2019s climate-focused presidential campaign and are delightfully similar to policies drafted by Data for Progress , an upstart leftwing thinktank where I work. (Full disclosure: we provided research and recommendations to the joint taskforce and campaign.) Now, Biden would be wise to run on these ideas and staff up his administration to make them happen. Over recent months, public opinion research from Data for Progress has shown that climate change is a uniquely favorable general election issue for Biden and Democrats. When it comes to climate and clean energy priorities, voters trust the Democratic party more than the Republican party by an 18% margin . Climate change is a strong mobilization issue for the young voters Biden has struggled to attract to his campaign. In a May survey , 61% of voters under 45 said they would be more likely to vote for Biden if he committed to a platform that would move the United States to a 100% clean energy economy, with just 14% reporting that such a platform would make them less likely to support the Democratic nominee. A more recent survey fielded in late June by Climate Power, the\nNew Deal's timeline is more aggressive, calling for a 10-year national mobilization to generate \"100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources.\" Both the Green New Deal and Biden's plan call for overhauling the American transportation industry to reduce pollution and greenhouse gases by creating more public transit and pushing the country toward more hybrid and electric cars. Biden's plan puts forth proposals like giving Americans rebates to trade in gas-guzzling vehicles for more efficient American cars, incentivizing auto companies to offer more zero-emission vehicles, and investing in 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, among other ideas. Biden calls Trump a \"climate arsonist\" amid historic wildfires 02:33 One area where Biden's position has differed more significantly from environmental activists \u2014 and many of his rivals in the Democratic presidential primaries \u2014 has been on fracking. Fracking, short for hydraulic fracturing, is a drilling method for extracting natural gas from shale formations underground by injecting liquid at high pressure. Since 2005, the use of fracking in the U.S. has grown exponentially . Some energy experts forecast the U.S. will be the world's top exporter of natural gas within the next few years. While the Green New Deal does not explicitly mention anything about fracking, its timeline to cut emissions from the power sector is so rapid that eliminating fracking is implied in the proposal. Banning fracking has certainly been a priority among climate activists. However, fracking is a substantial source of jobs and revenue in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania, where some 32,000 workers are employed in the fracking and natural gas industry. Biden told voters there in July that fracking \"is not on the chopping block,\" though his campaign says he supports no new fracking on federal land. \"It is not surprising that Biden said he doesn't support a Green New Deal. He has a climate plan that's in line with science \u2014 but he has never vocally supported a GND,\" says Emily Atkin, a popular climate journalist who writes and hosts HEATED , a newsletter and podcast followed closely by many progressive climate crusaders. \"This is completely in line with who he said he was. Also, he's trying to win Pennsylvania.\" (According to the latest CBS News Battleground Tracker poll , Biden currently leads President Trump in the state by 5 points.) Though he's faced some criticism over fracking from\nfor Biden if he committed to a platform that would move the United States to a 100% clean energy economy, with just 14% reporting that such a platform would make them less likely to support the Democratic nominee. A more recent survey fielded in late June by Climate Power, the Global Strategies Group and Data for Progress found that bold climate action was also persuasive for middle-of-the-road and Latino voters. Even after survey respondents were shown strong messaging attacks from Trump and Republicans claiming that Democrats wanted to pass a $100tn Green New Deal that would increase taxes \u2013 as well as more outlandish arguments that Democrats were going to take away hamburgers, pickup trucks and airplanes \u2013 voters moved even further in Democrats\u2019 direction. Middle partisans shifted two percentage points further in favor of Biden, while Latinos leaned a further four points towards him. These findings show that one of Trump and Republicans\u2019 favorite act: that \u201cVenezuela-style socialists are going to take away the American way of life\u201d \u2013 doesn\u2019t work. In fact, an analysis of the 2019 Cooperative Congressional Election Study published by Data for Progress found that 2016 Trump voters who are unsure how they will vote in 2020 are uniquely cross-pressured on climate issues. They view climate change as being much more important than other 2016 Trump voters and side with Biden and Democrats on key policy issues, like the Paris Climate Agreement and Clean Power Plan. Crucially, they also tend to be young, meaning that if Democrats can attract these voters in 2020, they could grow their base for years to come. As Biden prepares for election day in November, he would be wise to run on his Green New Deal-style climate plan. And if he wins \u2013 which polls suggest he will \u2013 he\u2019s going to need to staff up to turn these campaign promises into laws. Here, activists still have a lot of leverage. The most recent polling from Data for Progress shows that 44% of voters would be more likely to support a candidate who doesn\u2019t take money from fossil fuel companies, executives and lobbyists and that 49% would be opposed to industry representatives receiving appointments to government agencies and the White House. These are strange and scary times. The pandemic has laid bare some of the most devastating and brutal flaws of our corrupt president and our nakedly capitalist society. The\nattempting to tackle other related issues such as environmental justice, sustainable housing, supporting a \"just transition\" for workers whose jobs are affected, and the building of major infrastructure projects such as high speed rail, which is mentioned in both proposals. Green jobs and infrastructure At their core, both the Green New Deal and Biden's climate plan are about jobs as well as the environment. They both place an emphasis on supporting labor unions' right to organize and bargain for fair wages for their members. The Green New Deal sets a goal of providing a guaranteed job with a family-sustaining wage and benefits to every American \u2014 but Biden does not go that far. Biden's jobs plan is big, but not as comprehensive as the Green New Deal's. He pledges to create millions of new jobs by retooling the auto industry for low-emission vehicles, building infrastructure for a green future, upgrading millions of buildings to be more energy efficient, constructing 1.5 million new sustainable housing units, and cleaning up pollution from oil and gas wells and coal mining sites. \"When Donald Trump thinks about climate change, he thinks 'hoax.' I think 'jobs',\" Biden has said . He aims to provide additional jobs out of the pandemic by boosting this green energy economy. Climate change is also expected to continually increase major stresses on America's already aging infrastructure. To address this, both plans call for major investments to, as the Green New Deal puts it, \"meet the challenges of the 21st century.\" Biden's plan calls for making \"smart infrastructure investments to rebuild the nation and to ensure that our buildings, water, transportation, and energy infrastructure can withstand the impacts of climate change.\" However, on housing, Biden's proposal to build 1.5 million new sustainable housing units is far short of the lofty ambitions of the Green New Deal, which calls for \"providing all people of the United States with affordable, safe, and adequate housing.\" Carbon emissions and fracking On emissions reductions, Biden's plan calls for a carbon pollution-free U.S. power sector by 2035, with net-zero emissions throughout the economy by 2050. The Green New Deal's timeline is more aggressive, calling for a 10-year national mobilization to generate \"100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources.\" Both the Green New Deal and Biden's plan call for overhauling the American transportation industry to reduce pollution and"}], "source": "rag_only"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 5, "concluded_by_rag": true, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.4}

CNN hosted the debate , which had no audience, at its Atlanta studio. CNN anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash moderated.

Trump's outlandish immigration claim Trump says Biden \"allowed millions of people to come in here from prisons, jails and mental institutions.\" Pants on Fire! Immigration officials arrested about 103,700 noncitizens with criminal convictions (whether in the U.S. or abroad) from fiscal years 2021 to 2024, federal data shows. That accounts for people stopped at and between ports of entry. Not everyone was let in. The term \"noncitizens\" includes people who may have had legal immigration status in the U.S. but were not U.S. citizens. The data reflects the people that the federal government knows about, but it's inexhaustive. However, immigration experts said despite the data's limitations, there is no evidence to support Trump's statement. Biden's close to the mark about immigration reductions Biden: \"I've changed (the law) in the way that now you're in a situation where there are 40 percent fewer people coming across the border illegally.\" Mostly True.

President Donald Trump's first line of the night, about COVID-19 deaths, was false and set the tone as he and Democratic rival Joe Biden unleashed a torrent of claims in their last presidential debate . Trump misrepresented the reality of the pandemic in myriad and familiar ways, insisting against obvious reality that the pandemic is drawing to a close. He also boasted about \"clean\" facilities at the border for migrant children, ignoring the filthy conditions under which they were held in 2018. Biden, at times, was selective on the coronavirus and other matters, at one point stating that no one under Obamacare lost private health coverage. Millions did. A look at how some of the statements on the stage in Nashville, Tennessee, compared with the facts: CORONAVIRUS TRUMP: \"We're rounding the turn. We're rounding the corner. It's going away.\" THE FACTS: No, the coronavirus isn't going away. It's coming back. New cases are on the rise toward their summer peak. Deaths have also been increasing. According to data through Oct. 21 from Johns Hopkins University, the seven-day rolling average for daily new cases in the U.S. rose over the past two weeks from over 42,300 on Oct. 7 to nearly 60,000 on Oct. 21. In that time the seven-day rolling average for daily new deaths in the U.S. rose from 695 to 757. ___ TRUMP: \"All he does is talk about shutdowns. But forget about him.

Facts First: It\u2019s false that Biden never said he opposed fracking. In two Democratic primary debates, Biden made confusing remarks over fracking that his campaign had to clarify. In 2019, Biden said \u201cwe would make sure it\u2019s eliminated\u201d when asked about the future of coal and fracking; in 2020 he said he opposed \u201cnew fracking.\u201d Biden\u2019s written plan , conversely, never included a full ban on fracking or even on new fracking. Rather, it proposes \u201cbanning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters\u201d \u2013 not ending all new fracking anywhere or ending all existing fracking on public lands and waters.

By that time, southern Democrats were fully hostile to the Supreme Court because of its desegregation decisions, and conservative Republicans were worried about the Supreme Court over national security issues, and Stewart got a fair grilling. But like other nominees, he didn't provide them any answers. RAZ: When you say he didn't provide them any answers, he answered their questions, but they weren't particularly substantive? Prof. POWE: That's right. He wouldn't give them the information they were looking for. RAZ: Professor Powe, nowadays it seems, you know, if you make it to the confirmation stage, you're pretty much in. Of course, there was one notable exception in the last 30 years, and that was Judge Bork. Can we really learn anything about these nominees during this process? Prof. POWE: I don't think that we do. We certainly learn that they are willing to obfuscate, because now we seem to give points to the nominee for the ability to avoid answering the questions being asked. Take Justice Scalia. When he was questioned by the senators, one senator asked him: Do you consider Marbury versus Madison settled law? And of course, it's been settled law since it came down in 1803, and Justice Scalia refused to answer on the grounds that the question might come before him as a justice. (Soundbite of laughter) A little later, both Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg were asked whether the Korean War was a war, and both of them declined to answer. RAZ: Professor Powe, will you be watching the Sotomayor hearings? Prof. POWE: If it's a 106 in Austin, I certainly will. (Soundbite of laughter) RAZ: Lucas Powe is a professor of law and government at the University of Texas in Austin. His latest book is called \"The Supreme Court and the American Elite, 1789-2008.\" Professor Powe, thanks for helping us out. Prof. POWE: Thank you very much.

Just 36% of Americans polled in December by NPR/PBS News/Marist said they approve of how he is handling the economy, and more than 1 in 3 said their personal finances had deteriorated in the past year. Consumer confidence is near the lows reached when inflation was around 9% in mid-2022 under President Joe Biden. The picture Trump painted also skewed the facts. Trump exaggerated, by trillions of dollars, the amount of expected foreign investment he has attracted to the U.S. He overstated the historic scale of tax cuts in his domestic spending law and its savings for older Americans, and he repeated false talking points about the number of immigrants in the country illegally and their origin . He said crime has been at record levels, but violent crime rates were roughly twice as high in the early 1990s.

That\u2019s approximately the total for defense budgets from 2017 to 2020, but the cost of purchasing new military equipment was 20% of that. It\u2019s true the Defense Department budgets passed under Trump \u2014 which total $2.9 trillion, in inflation-adjusted dollars, actually \u2014 have been larger than they were in the latter years of his predecessor. In the last four years under then-President Barack Obama, the defense budgets, in inflation-adjusted dollars, totaled $2.7 trillion, but the budgets in Obama\u2019s first four years were nearly $3.3 trillion. Those are the budget authority figures \u2014 the amounts Congress appropriated \u2014 from the Defense Department comptroller\u2019s budget report released this year. (Note: The fiscal 2009 defense budget was signed by then-President George W. Bush four months before Obama took office. The fiscal 2017 budget, which began on Oct. 1, 2016, when Obama was still in office, was signed by Trump. ) So, in context, the amount Trump is touting isn\u2019t all that unusual. On occasion, Trump has emphasized the \u201ctrillion,\u201d as he did in a speech at West Point on June 13 : \u201c[W]e have invested over 2 trillion \u2014 trillion; that\u2019s with a \u2018T\u2019 \u2014 dollars in the most powerful fighting force, by far, on the planet Earth.\u201d On May 22, he falsely claimed military funding \u201cused to be \u2018million.\u2019 And then, about 10 years ago, you started hearing \u2018billion.\u2019 And now you\u2019re starting to hear \u2018trillion,\u2019 right?\u201d That\u2019s wrong. The defense budget has been in the billions each year dating back to 1948 (as far as the Defense Department tables go). And those yearly budgets are still in the billions. As we said, Trump gets to \u201ctrillion\u201d by adding together several years. The president repeatedly has claimed all of the budget money was spent on equipment, such as ships, fighter jets, tanks and weapons. He made that assertion on June 25 when speaking at a shipbuilding company in Wisconsin. \u201cWe\u2019ve totally rebuilt the military \u2014 $2.5 trillion,\u201d Trump said, going on to talk about a contract awarded to that shipbuilding company , Fincantieri Marinette Marine, \u201cto build the next generation of guided missile"}], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 5, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.4}

{"claim": "PEDOPHILIA is now LEGAL in CALIFORNIA", "label": "Refuted", "result": {"response": "To assess the factual accuracy of the statement \"PEDOPHILIA is now LEGAL in CALIFORNIA,\" we need to analyze the provided knowledge points regarding child trafficking legislation in California.\n\n1. **Child Trafficking Legislation**: The knowledge indicates that California lawmakers have made multiple attempts to stiffen penalties for child trafficking, particularly for minors involved in commercial sex acts. The latest effort to reclassify child trafficking of a minor as a \"serious felony\" was met with significant public backlash, leading to renewed legislative action.\n\n2. **Current Legal Framework**: Under current California law, human trafficking of a minor for commercial sex incurs severe penalties, including a sentence of up to 12 years in prison, and potentially 15 years to life if certain aggravating factors are present. This indicates that the state has laws in place that criminalize the exploitation of minors.\n\n3. **Legislative Actions**: The knowledge points out that there has been a push to strengthen laws against child trafficking, and the recent bill aimed to impose harsher penalties on offenders. This suggests that there is an ongoing effort to combat child exploitation rather than legalize it.\n\n4. **Public and Political Response**: The backlash against the failure of the bill and the threats received by lawmakers indicate that there is a strong societal and political will to protect children from exploitation, further reinforcing that pedophilia is not legal in California.\n\nBased on these points, the statement that \"PEDOPHILIA is now LEGAL in CALIFORNIA\" is inaccurate. The legislative efforts and existing laws demonstrate a commitment to criminalizing such acts rather than legalizing them.\n\nThus, the conclusion is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "Child trafficking bill returns after CA Democrats relent - CalMatters Track Your Legislator Politics Immigration Housing Education Economy Environment California Voices Impact Events Assembly Republicans convene during session at the state Capitol in Sacramento on July 13, 2023. Photo by Rahul Lal for CalMatters In summary California lawmakers tried nine times to stiffen penalties for trafficking of a minor. The latest effort appeared to die \u2014 until a social media campaign forced Democrats to reconsider. It was a perfunctory committee hearing on a day full of them in the Legislature. The measure in question on Tuesday wasn\u2019t novel, just another in a long list of attempts to reclassify a misdemeanor as a felony. Like most attempts before it, it met a quiet and undignified end. The bill was new, but what it sought to do was not. Lawmakers from both parties had made numerous previous attempts to reclassify human trafficking of a minor for purposes of a commercial sex act as a \u201cserious felony,\u201d which would be treated as a strike under California\u2019s Three Strikes law. In 2007, twice in 2009, 2011, 2013, 2017 and three times in 2021, legislators tried and failed to reclassify child sex trafficking. But then something strange happened after the latest effort went down. A backlash swiftly took shape on social media. Comments ranged from \u201cWhat on earth were these Democrats thinking?\u201d to accusations that they were siding with pedophiles \u2014 and at least one Democratic member of the Assembly Public Safety Committee that quashed the bill reported receiving death threats. Soon the bill, which had already passed the Senate unanimously, began collecting new, high-profile allies. Gov. Gavin Newsom at a press conference expressed dismay at its failure, telling reporters that he\u2019d reach out to the bill\u2019s Republican author, Sen. Shannon Grove of Bakersfield. Newly seated Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas , a Salinas Democrat, also said he was \u201cvery much engaged\u201d in trying to move the bill forward. So on Thursday the Assembly Public Safety Committee took it up again. And on the second go-around, it passed. Human trafficking of a minor for purposes of commercial sex under current law incurs a sentence of up to 12 years in prison. If the crime involved force, fear, fraud, deceit, coercion, violence, duress, menace, or threat of unlawful injury to the victim or to another person, the sentence is 15 years to life. If the person is\nPublic Safety Committee did the right thing and passed (the bill) that will make sure repeat offenders of child sex trafficking are held accountable,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones, a San Diego Republican. \u201cIf it were not for the extraordinary pushback from figures around the state and nation, I fear the Democrats\u2019 one-party rule and some of their radical ideologies would have prevailed.\u201d The bill\u2019s author, Grove, said in a statement that she expects the cooperation of Assembly Democrats should the bill reach the floor \u2013 its next stop is the Assembly Appropriations Committee. \u201cProtecting victims of child sex trafficking should not be a partisan issue,\u201d Grove said. \u201cToday is a victory for every survivor.\u201d CalMatters newsletter writer Lynn La contributed to this report.

If the crime involved force, fear, fraud, deceit, coercion, violence, duress, menace, or threat of unlawful injury to the victim or to another person, the sentence is 15 years to life. If the person is convicted of inflicting great bodily harm on the victim while trafficking them, a judge can add up to 10 years to a prison sentence. If the child trafficking bill passes the full Assembly and Newsom signs it, people convicted of the crime would face longer prison terms and potential life sentences. The 48 hours between Tuesday\u2019s original vote and Thursday\u2019s session was yet another collision of California\u2019s goals of reducing incarceration by moving away from tough-on-crime laws, and the political reality of negative advertising. More than a decade ago, then-Assemblymember Richard Pan tried to add five new offenses related to human trafficking and the abuse of a child to the serious felony list. The 2011 measure never made it out of committee. Pan, a Democrat who was in both the Assembly and Senate, said he was not sure what was different this time. \u201cSometimes you never know what gets the attention of the public,\u201d Pan said. \u201cThere are these tensions (between reducing the prison population and harsher sentences). \u201cBut we don\u2019t start off by saying abusing children is not a serious crime.\u201d Some progressive lawmakers have opposed toughening penalties for sex trafficking because they were persuaded that it would contribute to the over-incarceration of Black people, and needlessly extend already-significant prison sentences \u2014costing taxpayers more money while demonstrating little public benefit. Opponents also have contended that harsher sentences may end up being applied to people at the lowest rungs of trafficking, who may be trafficked themselves. \u201cThere is no evidence that long prison sentences deter or prevent crime,\u201d the advocacy group Sister Warriors Freedom Coalition wrote in opposition to the bill. \u201cIf anything, low-level individuals involved in human trafficking will be prosecuted under this legislation, many of them will be prosecuted for conduct done under duress or other pressures, and they will be easily and swiftly replaced.\u201d But nuance like that can be difficult, if not impossible, to persuasively convey in a political campaign \u2014 and this was an issue conservatives knew they could weaponize against Democrats.

The fallout was quick and fierce after Democratic members of the Assembly Public Safety Committee abstained from voting on the bill Tuesday, effectively blocking it. \u201cYou can choose a team, pick pedophiles or children,\u201d Assemblymember Heath Flora, a Ripon Republican, said Thursday morning.

The volume from Twitter, Republicans and some Democrats led at least one committee member to change her mind. \u201cOn Tuesday, I made a bad decision,\u201d Assemblymember Liz Ortega , a Hayward Democrat, wrote Thursday on Twitter. \u201cVoting against legislation targeting really bad people who traffic children was wrong. I regret doing that and I am going to help get this important legislation passed into law.\u201d Ultimately Bonta and Assemblymember Isaac Bryant both abstained from voting on the bill in the Assembly Public Safety Committee hearing on Thursday. Assemblymember Reggie Jones-Sawyer, a Los Angeles Democrat and chair of the committee, said the vote on Thursday was so markedly different from Tuesday\u2019s vote because questions he had about the bill were answered in the interim. Republicans on child trafficking bill Noting the death threats against Bonta, Jones-Sawyer said in a hallway interview that the \u201cTrumpian hate \u2026 is just wrong.\u201d \u201cYou can have an honest debate, but, my god, you should not threaten a woman because of her personal feelings on an issue,\u201d he said. After the bill cleared the Assembly Public Safety Committee, Republican legislators celebrated the victory in a state where they rarely get to do so. \u201cIn the end, my Democrat colleagues in the Assembly Public Safety Committee did the right thing and passed (the bill) that will make sure repeat offenders of child sex trafficking are held accountable,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones, a San Diego Republican. \u201cIf it were not for the extraordinary pushback from figures around the state and nation, I"}], "source": "rag_only"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 5, "concluded_by_rag": true, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.4}

Rating: False About this rating In September 2020, as social media users accused Netflix of promoting pedophilia due to a promotional poster for the award-winning French film \"Cuties,\" the website TorontoToday.net published an article claiming that Reed Hastings, the streaming service's CEO, had been arrested on suspicion of possession of child pornography: This is not a genuine news report. Hastings was not arrested by the FBI, and the accusations circulating on social media that the Netflix CEO was involved in child pornography are baseless and largely driven by pedophilia panic that consumed portions of the internet in 2020. Hasting is the CEO of one of the world's largest streaming services. If he truly had been arrested by the FBI, it would certainly warrant a press release from the FBI, and would undoubtedly make headlines in credible media outlets. However, the only source for this news appears to be random social media posts and an article published to a website with a history of spreading misinformation. TorontoToday.net is a relatively new website, but it has already been responsible for at least two viral hoaxes. Shortly after Black Panther actor Chadwick Boseman died from colon cancer, the website published a false report claiming that he had been poisoned. The website was also responsible for the false rumor that Russian President Vladimir Putin's daughter had died from a COVID-19 vaccine. The website deleted its false report about Hasting's arrest, but an archived version of the page can be found here . It appears that TorontoToday.net originally published this article under the headline \"Netflix CEO gets BUSTED with 13,000 files of CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.\" Then, the site updated the article to include the word \"reports\" before the headline, and deleted the original text of the article claiming a\nnature of the sexual abuse, and evidence of a \"clandestine drug lab\" discovered during the raid. The website Toronto Today has been responsible for multiple other misinformation hoaxes in the past few months, per Snopes and Lead Stories . Netflix did not respond to a request for comment on behalf of Hastings. Our rating: False Based on our research, the claim that Netflix CEO Reed Hastings was arrested for child pornography is FALSE. The claim appeared in an article from a website with a record of misinformation, according to other fact-checkers, and details from that article appeared to have been lifted from a report on an unrelated arrest of another individual in December 2019.

This fake report about the arrest of Netflix CEO Reed Hasting is just the latest in a long series of false rumors concerning pedophilia. In 2020, pedophilia panic consumed portions of the internet, in large part because these false rumors were being amplified by the growing QAnon conspiracy movement. In the last few months alone, we've covered false rumors about furniture stores trafficking children via large cabinets , department stores promoting pedophilia by selling shirts containing images of pizza , and the country of Greece classifying pedophilia as a disability. While pedophilia and sex trafficking are certainly real issues, the aforementioned stories are false. In fact, the National Human Trafficking Hotline released a statement saying that these pedophilia conspiracy theories were making it more difficult to help people who are actually in danger of being trafficked.

Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton, and Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard \u2014 over its recent release of the film \"Cuties,\" which has been criticized for sexualizing young girls. Amid the controversy, unfounded claims about Netflix CEO Reed Hastings have swirled on social media. Posts on Facebook and Instagram included a screenshot of a headline that claimed \"Netflix CEO gets BUSTED with 13,000 files of CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.\" The headline came from an article on the webpage Toronto Today. The story \u2014 which was archived on Sept. 12 prior to its removal from the site \u2014 claimed that Hastings was arrested at his home in California and faces \"11 charges related to the seizure of more than 13,000 files of graphic child pornography on his computer and various removable storage units.\" The users behind the posts did not respond to requests from USA TODAY for comment. Toronto Today denied being the original source of the false story, and noted in an email to USA TODAY that Netflix and Hastings have faced accusations of distributing child pornography since the release of \"Cuties.\" Story is false, details taken from an unrelated arrest of someone else in December 2019 The claims in the screenshots and the story from Toronto Today are false.

This was primarily due to concerns about shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers and the potential for masks to lead to increased face-touching and reduced social distancing.\n\n2. **Evolving Guidance**: As more evidence emerged about the transmission of COVID-19, particularly from asymptomatic individuals, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) changed its recommendations in early April 2020, endorsing the use of masks for the general public. This change was based on studies indicating that masks could reduce transmission rates.\n\n3. **Effectiveness of Masks**: Research, including studies from Duke University, has shown that if a significant percentage of the population wears masks, it can lead to a reduction in COVID-19 transmission. For instance, it was noted that if 95% of people wear cloth masks when within 6 feet of others, it could reduce transmission by at least 30%.\n\n4. **Conclusion on Masks**: While masks are not a foolproof method to completely stop the spread of COVID-19, they are effective in reducing transmission rates when used in conjunction with other preventive measures like social distancing and hand hygiene.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement \"Wearing face masks will stop the spread of COVID-19\" is misleading.

We've learned a lot. But Anthony said don't wear masks. Now he wants to wear masks.\" FACT CHECK: Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the top infectious disease experts in the country, and other public health experts initially told Americans not to wear surgical or N95 masks in the early days of what has become the COVID-19 pandemic. At the beginning of the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, as well as Fauci and other top experts, initially discouraged wearing masks because of concerns that masks and other personal protective equipment were in short supply for health care workers who needed them. Public health officials were also concerned wearing masks could have unintended consequences if people touched their face more often to adjust them or fail to keep social distancing. \"There was this feeling that there would be a shortage just for those who really need them very early on,\" Fauci said in a recent interview. \"That was the big deal. We didn't have enough PPE including masks. Then it became clear that cloth masks worked reasonably well. And therefore there was no more shortage. Then the different analyses, meta analyses and others came in that in fact, it does work.\" In early April, the CDC changed its recommendation about face coverings for the general public, based on evidence that a significant number of people who were asymptomatic or not yet feeling sick were transmitting the virus.

However, the impact of prolonged face mask wearing on nasal microbiota of healthy people is not fully understood. Methods: In this study, we compared the nasal microbiota of 82 young adults who wore face masks for an extended period of time to 172 mask-free peers from the same school recruited before the COVID-19 pandemic via 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Diversity, composition, and function of nasal microbiota between the two groups were analyzed. Prevalence of commensal bacteria colonized in the nasal cavity was determined by culture-based analysis. Results: We observed that prolonged face mask wearers had significantly different nasal microbial characterization and metabolic function compared to mask-free controls from 2018. Specifically, the nasal microbiota of the prolonged mask wearers displayed increased abundance of Staphylococcus , Pseudoalteromonas , Corynebacterium , etc. Meanwhile, the abundance of several genera including Bacteroides , Faecalibacterium , and Agathobacter was decreased. Moreover, we observed that COVID-19 infection history did not affect the composition of nasal microbiota significantly. Additionally, the culture-based analysis revealed that Staphylococcus aureus and Corynebacterium accolens increased, and Staphylococcus epidermidis decreased in the nasal cavity of prolonged mask wearers. Conclusions: Overall, our study suggests that prolonged face mask wearing can significantly alter the nasal microbiota. Introduction The nasal microbiota plays a crucial role in the maintenance of respiratory health, and disturbance in its composition and structure may lead to various respiratory disorders ( 1 ). It has been reported that chronic rhinosinusitis and chronic neurological diseases are linked to dysbiosis of nasal microbiota\nparties, including Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP have decided to cover their faces during debates. But Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg last week said Conservatives did not need to do so because they knew each other well, and this meant they were complying with government guidance. And he claimed Labour MPs only wore masks when the television cameras were around. The latest official guidance says people in England should cover their faces around \"people you don't normally meet\". It comes as the World Health Organisation (WHO) urged MPs to wear masks during Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget speech, when there is likely to be standing room only in the Commons chamber. Dr David Nabarro, the WHO's special envoy for Covid-19, told Sky News that \"everybody\" should be wearing masks in close confinement with other people, \"including our leaders\". \"This virus, it is absolutely unstoppable, it gets everywhere, and so we have to do everything we possibly can to stop it. \"And one of the best ways to stop it is a well-fitting surgical mask properly over your face, pushed in over your nose, covering everything, and that reduces the risk to others and the risk to you. \"If it works, why on earth don't people use it? It's not a party political issue - this virus doesn't vote.\" Garry Graham, deputy general secretary of the union Prospect, said the public looked to MPs to set an example. \"It's welcome that House authorities are finally catching on to what unions have been saying, that it's too early to relax. But we're still left in the ludicrous situation where MPs do as they please on masks while everyone else does the right thing,\" he said. \"Continuously changing an already inconsistent message is a recipe for non-compliance and increased risk to everyone.\" House of Commons Chancellor's Autumn Statement Personal protective equipment (PPE)\nby RGM Al-Allaff \u00b7 2021 \u00b7 Cited by 7 \u2014 b>Background and Objective:</b> COVID-19 is a fast-spreading worldwide pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2.

At the start of the outbreak, Dr Anthony Fauci, the White House top infectious disease expert, recommended the US public didn't wear face coverings. But he says his early comments have been taken out of context, claiming he was initially cautious because there was a shortage of PPE for healthcare professionals. In early March, Dr Fauci said: \"It could lead to a shortage of masks for the people who really need it.\" By the end of March, Fauci said recommending face coverings outside a healthcare setting was under \"serious consideration\". Since April, Dr Fauci as well as the CDC have recommended the use of face coverings in certain settings to help slow the spread of coronavirus. Biden: \"We have 4% of the world's population, [but] 20% of the deaths\". Verdict: This is roughly correct. The US population is around 328 million, which is just over 4% of the 7.7 billion global population. There have been over 225,000 coronavirus deaths recorded in the US, according to the latest John Hopkins University data. The total number of deaths recorded worldwide is around 1,161,000. On this metric, the US accounts for over 19% of Covid-19 deaths worldwide, although the way countries record their figures varies considerably.

These aerosols are carried in the flow of air as someone breathes, and are significantly smaller than the pore / perforation size of common mask materials. All common types of masks also suffer from leakage through gaps around the edges, rendering them ineffective. Any higher grade mask (really designed for specialist industrial applications) that is not professionally fitted will also likely be ineffective due to leakage. The world-wide data that is now available from places where mask mandates were imposed consistently shows no measurable effect on infection spread. Added to that, inappropriate use of various computer modelling methods has resulted in misleading evidence being used to promote the efficacy of masks in preventing transmission, which they simply do not do.\u201d Co-chair Graham Stringer MP said : \u201cThe new Prime Minister and Health Secretary should not impose mask wearing again unless they can produce high quality evidence that the benefits far outweigh the harms to the individual and society as a whole. Our APPG has heard from experts that this evidence does not appear to exist and so policy makers should not be reintroducing such measures on a \u2018just in case\u2019 basis.

Now he wants to wear masks.\" FACT CHECK: Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of the top infectious disease experts in the country, and other public health experts initially told Americans not to wear surgical or N95 masks in the early days of what has become the COVID-19 pandemic. At the beginning of the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, as well as Fauci and other top experts, initially discouraged wearing masks because of concerns that masks and other personal protective equipment were in short supply for health care workers who needed them. Public health officials were also concerned wearing masks could have unintended consequences if people touched their face more often to adjust them or fail to keep social distancing. \"There was this feeling that there would be a shortage just for those who really need them very early on,\" Fauci said in a recent interview. \"That was the big deal. We didn't have enough PPE including masks. Then it became clear that cloth masks worked reasonably well. And therefore there was no more shortage. Then the different analyses, meta analyses and others came in that in fact, it does work.\" In early April, the CDC changed its recommendation about face coverings for the general public, based on evidence that a significant number of people who were asymptomatic or not yet feeling sick were transmitting the virus. Duke University researchers have also concluded that \"if 95 percent of people wear cloth masks when within 6 feet of other people in public, it will reduce COVID-19 transmission by at least 30 percent.\" Trump also said he thought Fauci was a Democrat, but Fauci is not registered as a member of any political party, according to D.C. voting records. --Stephanie Ebbs and Arielle Mitropoulos President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden participate in the final presidential debate at Belmont University, Oct. 22, 2020, in Nashville, Tenn.

The briefing comes as some commentators call for the return of face coverings this winter. The Group\u2019s Chair, Esther McVey , said in response to the briefing: \u201cAt the start of the pandemic, we were advised against wearing face masks. The WHO and the chief and deputy chief medical officers, Drs Chris Whitty and Jenny Harries, were clear that there was very little evidence of a widespread benefit from wearing masks, yet they were mandated in July 2020. No high quality scientific evidence of the benefits was forthcoming at the time and the WHO even admitted the policy reversal was due to political lobbying. After hearing from experts today, it is clear we still do not have that evidence. \u201cInstead there is considerable evidence showing that mask wearing in the community has very limited benefits. Not enough to warrant their blanket reintroduction, as some recent media coverage has suggested would be a good idea, to avoid future lockdowns. What we do now know, are the considerable physical, psychological and environmental harms caused by masks. I sincerely hope the Prime Minister and Health Secretary will take on board that lack of evidence and not bow to pressure to re-impose a policy based on scientific uncertainty.\u201d Professor Robert Dingwall, consulting sociologist, researcher and writer spoke to the group about his concerns over the evidential uncertainty that still surrounds mask wearing: \u201cIn a situation of scientific uncertainty, judgements about action are moral and political. This is precisely where we find ourselves with masks. As SAGE reviews have repeatedly stated, there is, at best, weak evidence of a very small effect. If there were a strong effect, we would expect to see it in randomised controlled trials and the better observational studies. Potential harms must also be considered, as the precautionary principle requires in such a decision making process, not just the potential benefits. Harms are often under-reported and overlooked while benefits are over interpreted and exaggerated. \u201cCorrectly worn, some types of mask may have an individual benefit for self-protection. Individuals are free to wear one, if they choose."}], "source": "rag_only"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 5, "concluded_by_rag": true, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.4}

It mentions that the barrier is intended to reduce illegal crossings and drug trafficking.\n\n2. **Apprehensions and Trends**: The data shows that in 2010, 97% of border apprehensions occurred at the southwest border, and there was a significant decline in apprehensions from 2005 to 2010. However, it also notes that while barriers may deter crossings in some areas, they have led to increased crossings in areas without barriers, such as deserts.\n\n3. **Drug Seizures**: The statement from the Acting Commissioner mentions that the wall helps shape the behavior of cartels and has contributed to the seizure of over a million pounds of drugs in a year. This suggests that while drug trafficking may still occur, the presence of barriers has had some impact on the operational capacity to manage it.\n\n4. **Human Trafficking**: The claim that human trafficking is down by 96% is presented in the context of the border being \"closed up.\" However, the knowledge does not provide specific data to confirm this percentage, and it is important to note that while barriers may reduce some illegal activities, they do not eliminate them entirely.\n\n5. **Overall Context**: The knowledge points indicate that while barriers may have some deterrent effect, they are not a comprehensive solution to illegal crossings, drug trafficking, or human smuggling. The effectiveness of barriers can vary significantly based on location and other factors.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement that \"Illegal drug, border crossings, and human smuggling activities have decreased in areas where barriers are deployed in the United States\" is somewhat misleading.

[ 13 ] Description [ edit ] The 1,954-mile (3,145-kilometer) border between Mexico and the U.S. traverses a variety of terrain, including urban areas and deserts. [ 14 ] The border from the Gulf of Mexico to El Paso, Texas , follows the Rio Grande , a natural barrier. The barrier is on both urban and uninhabited sections of the border, where the most illegal crossings and drug trafficking have been observed in the past. These urban areas include San Diego , California, and El Paso, Texas. [ 15 ] The fencing includes a steel fence (varying in height between 18 and 27 feet (4.8 and 8.1 meters)) that divides the border towns of Nogales, Arizona , in the U.S. and Nogales, Sonora , in Mexico. [ 16 ] 97% of border apprehensions (foreign nationals caught in the U.S. illegally) by the Border Patrol in 2010 occurred at the southwest border. The number declined 61% from 1,189,000 in 2005 to 723,842 in 2008 to 463,000 in 2010. The decrease in apprehensions is the result of numerous factors, including changes in U.S. economic conditions and border enforcement efforts. Border apprehensions in 2010 were at their lowest level since 1972. [ 15 ] [ 17 ] Total apprehensions for 2017, 2018, and 2019 were 415,517, 521,090, and 977,509, respectively. [ 18 ] And while the barrier is along the border with Mexico, 80% of those apprehended are not Mexican. [ 19 ] As a result of the barrier, the number of people trying to cross in areas that have no fence, such as the Sonoran Desert and the Baboquivari Mountains in Arizona, has increased.

Drugs \u2014 drugs alone \u2014 what this wall does is it helps us shape the behavior of the cartels. It puts us in an offensive position, just like the President said. Because of that, this year \u2014 year, to date \u2014 we\u2019ve seized over a million pounds of drugs. Think about that: this year, to date, a million pounds of drugs. And this wall is helping shape the behavior so that we can get better at doing that. We talked about criminals. We apprehend thousands of criminals every single year. Think about that. You know, a lot of these individuals are violent criminals. Because of this wall, we\u2019re able to apprehend and stop these criminals from coming into this country to repeat their offenses. So we have fewer victims of United States citizens because of the wall, because of what this President has provided us. Let\u2019s talk about gangs. Every single year, we stop hundreds and hundreds of gangs from pouring into this country \u2014 like MS-13, whose motto is \u201cRape, Kill, and Control.\u201d That\u2019s their motto: \u201cRape, Kill, and Control.\u201d Just recently \u2014 it wasn\u2019t that long ago \u2014 they used machetes to hack up their victims, and they actually leave them decapitated. That\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about when we\u2019re talking about what this tool provides us. And then, of course, illegal immigration: Even during the height of a global pandemic, illegal immigration continues. And they allow themselves to be put in stash houses that are unsanitary, unsafe. They\u2019re put in tractor trailers for days. I mean, there\u2019s COVID \u2014 that\u2019s like a COVID petri dish. But yet, they\u2019re coming across.\nthere have been more military operations at the border. The administration has also increased the number of expedited removals. Biden has tried to work with Congress to overhaul the immigration system, but a majority of Republican lawmakers have not moved forward with the Senate $118 billion border agreement . Claim 2: Biden\u2019s executive order has reduced illegal migration Unable to act more broadly without Congress, Biden has implemented a handful of policies aimed at reducing the number of crossings, and asylum claims, at the Southern border over the last few months. One June 4, Biden issued executive actions severely restricted asylum claims between ports of entry , blocking most unauthorized migrants from attaining asylum. The Biden administration has said that since the policy went into effect, there has been a 40% decrease in unauthorized crossings. But these types of dips are not surprising. Historically, these policies deter migrants for a short period of time, but those numbers tend to go up, according to an analysis by the D.C.-based Washington Office on Latin America. Migrants tend to go into a wait-and-see period before crossing again. Many migrants who have talked to NPR in Mexican border communities have said they will attempt to cross, despite the policies . Of note: Biden\u2019s asylum restrictions mirror those implemented by Trump, but that Biden lifted in 2021 . Claim 3: Migrants crossing are committing crimes There is no doubt that some migrants who have crossed the border without authorization have committed crimes. This has been something Republicans have been hammering on recently, after two Venezuelan immigrants were charged with capital murder for killing a 12-year-old girl. But data shows a vast majority of immigrants do not commit crimes. In fact, a study by Northwestern University examining a 150-year period found that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than people born in the U.S. Facebook Flipboard Email\nnow you're in a situation where there are 40 percent fewer people coming across the border illegally.\" Mostly True. The Department of Homeland Security announced that illegal immigration encounters dropped by 40 percent, to fewer than 2,400 each day , in the weeks after Biden announced a policy largely barring asylum access for people entering the U.S. at the southern border. The policy was announced June 4. But immigration experts caution that it's difficult to pinpoint a single reason for any change in border crossings. For example, other factors, such as hot weather , can affect migration patterns. Since the policy was announced only a few weeks ago, it's unclear whether the drop in illegal immigration will continue . Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, associate policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, told PolitiFact the policy could have a short-term deterrent effect. But Adam Isacson, defense oversight director at the Washington Office on Latin America told PolitiFact, that no crackdown in the past decade has had a lasting impact . Trump's falsehoods about his and Biden's economic achievements Trump: \"I gave you the largest tax cut in history.\" False. When it was passed in 2017, Trump's tax cut was, in inflation-adjusted dollars, the fourth-largest since 1940. And as a percentage of gross domestic product, it ranked seventh in history, according to figures published by the Treasury Department. Trump: \"The only jobs (Biden) created are for illegal immigrants and bounceback jobs, bounce back from the COVID.\" False. Since Biden took office in early 2021, the number of foreign-born Americans who are employed has risen by about 5.6 million. But over the same time period, the number of native-born Americans employed has increased by almost 7.4 million. (There are many more native-born Americans than foreign-born Americans, so on a percentage basis, the increase for foreign-born Americans is about 22 percent, compared with 6 percent for native-born Americans.) It's also wrong to say that all the foreign-born employment gains (much less all the employment gains, period) stem from migrants here illegally. The data for foreign-born Americans includes anyone born outside the U.S., including immigrants who have been in the United States legally for decades. Employment on Biden's watch passed its prepandemic level by June 2022, about a year-and-a-half into his term. Since then, the U.S. economy has created an additional 6.2 million jobs.

So, thank you. So first of all, what you see behind me has saved American lives. Every single bit of concrete and steel that goes into the ground, the operational capacity of the men and women you\u2019re seeing right here goes exponentially higher to stop dangerous things and people from coming into this country. Drugs \u2014 drugs alone \u2014 what this wall does is it helps us shape the behavior of the cartels. It puts us in an offensive position, just like the President said. Because of that, this year \u2014 year, to date \u2014 we\u2019ve seized over a million pounds of drugs. Think about that: this year, to date, a million pounds of drugs. And this wall is helping shape the behavior so that we can get better at doing that. We talked about criminals. We apprehend thousands of criminals every single year. Think about that. You know, a lot of these individuals are violent criminals. Because of this wall, we\u2019re able to apprehend and stop these criminals from coming into this country to repeat their offenses. So we have fewer victims of United States citizens because of the wall, because of what this President has provided us. Let\u2019s talk about gangs. Every single year, we stop hundreds and hundreds of gangs from pouring into this country \u2014 like MS-13, whose motto is \u201cRape, Kill, and Control.\u201d That\u2019s their motto: \u201cRape, Kill, and Control.\u201d Just recently \u2014 it wasn\u2019t that long ago \u2014 they used machetes to hack up their victims, and they actually leave them decapitated. That\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about when we\u2019re talking about what this tool provides us. And then, of course, illegal immigration: Even during the height of a global pandemic, illegal immigration continues. And they allow themselves to be put in stash houses that are unsanitary, unsafe. They\u2019re put in tractor trailers for days. I mean, there\u2019s COVID \u2014 that\u2019s like a COVID petri dish.

President Barack Obama , a Democrat and former U.S. senator from Illinois , was ineligible to seek reelection to a third term due to the restrictions of the American presidential term limits established by the Twenty-second Amendment . [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Both the Democratic and Republican parties, as well as third parties such as the Green and Libertarian parties, held a series of presidential primary elections and caucuses that took place between February and June 2016, staggered among the 50 states, the District of Columbia , and U.S. territories . This nominating process was also an indirect election, where voters cast ballots for a slate of delegates to a political party's nominating convention , who in turn elected their party's presidential nominee. Speculation about the 2016 campaign began almost immediately following the 2012 campaign, with New York magazine declaring that the race had begun in an article published on November 8, two days after the 2012 election. [ 38 ] On the same day, Politico released an article predicting that the 2016 general election would be between Clinton and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush , while an article in The New York Times named New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Senator Cory Booker from New Jersey as potential candidates. [ 39 ] [ 40 ] Nominations Republican Party Primaries Main article: 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries With seventeen major candidates entering the race, starting with Ted Cruz on March 23, 2015, this was the largest presidential primary field for any political party in American history, [ 41 ] before being overtaken by the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries. [ 42 ] Prior to the Iowa caucuses on February 1, 2016, Perry, Walker, Jindal, Graham, and Pataki withdrew due to low polling numbers. Despite leading many polls in Iowa, Trump came in second to Cruz, after which Huckabee, Paul, and Santorum withdrew due to poor performances at the ballot box. Following a sizable victory for Trump in the New Hampshire primary , Christie, Fiorina, and Gilmore abandoned\nof weeks later, Trump said that he \u201cgenerally speaking would not\u201d use the Comstock Act to outlaw the shipment of abortion pills.

Salman Ghazi, managing director of Iqra Education Foundation, which provides religious curriculum to nearly 200 regular schools run by Muslim managements, said that the low participation of Muslims in higher education has its roots in the partition of the country. \"There was discrimination against Muslims in the aftermath. The tendency among young men was that higher education was a waste of time and money because they faced odds while aspiring for government jobs,\" said Ghazi. However, a Maharashtra cadre officer from the 1979 IAS batch said that low participation of Muslims in the exams, rather than discrimination, was the cause for their low representation in the services. \"As a Muslim, I never faced discrimination. Muslims were around 3.5% of the successful candidates at that time. I do not know whether it is true today, but the percentage of Muslim candidates was lower. However, the success rate for Muslims was higher. If there was discrimination, this would not be the case,\" said the former bureaucrat. There is also a consensus that the community was turning to higher education in larger numbers. \"Globalisation has reduced religious discrimination, and there are many Muslims in the corporate world in India. I think there has been a paradigm shift in the attitude to higher education. Wealthy Muslims are establishing schools. Even the Ulema - the clergy - is promoting schools rather than madrassas.

After the result was declared, many students came forward saying that there are discrepancies in the evaluation process. One student also filed a petition in the Bombay High Court after receiving zero marks in the NEET 2020 exams, even though while checking her OMR sheet, she had calculated herself getting at least 600 out of 720 marks. Another student has pointed out that as per the scanned OMR sheet uploaded by NTA, he has scored a perfect 720 out of 720, but according to the final scorecard, he scored a mere 212 in the NEET 2020 exams, which is highly unlikely. This year, the NEET 2020 exam result was released on October 16 and two students ended up scoring full marks i.e. 720 out of 720 in the medical entrance examination.

This implies a direct religious involvement in NASA's operations.\n\n2. **Analyzing the First Part**: The claim that NASA always receives blessings from the Pope suggests a consistent and formal relationship between NASA and the Vatican. While there have been instances where religious figures, including the Pope, have commented on space exploration or have blessed specific missions (for example, the blessing of the Mars rover), it is not accurate to say that this is a standard or required practice for all NASA missions.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Second Part**: The assertion that God's permission must be sought before a space mission implies a theological requirement for NASA's operations. NASA is a scientific organization that operates based on empirical evidence and scientific principles, not religious mandates. While individual scientists or astronauts may hold personal beliefs, these do not dictate the operational procedures of NASA.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The statement presents a misleading portrayal of NASA's relationship with religion. NASA does not have a formal requirement to seek blessings from the Pope or to seek God's permission for its missions. \n\nBased on this reasoning, the statement is not accurate.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 0, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.4}

Therefore, the claim that Biden supports \"open borders\" is misleading.\n\n2. **Sanctuary Cities**: The knowledge does not specifically address Biden's stance on sanctuary cities. However, it is known that many Democratic leaders, including Biden, have historically supported policies that allow local jurisdictions to limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. This aspect of the statement may have some basis but is not explicitly confirmed in the provided knowledge.\n\n3. **Free Lawyers for Illegal Immigrants**: The knowledge does not provide information regarding Biden's position on providing free legal representation for illegal immigrants. This claim would require further verification.\n\n4. **Health Care for Illegal Immigrants**: The knowledge points out that Biden has stated that it is inhumane to let people who are sick go uncovered, implying support for health care access for undocumented immigrants. However, it also clarifies that the candidates in a debate raised their hands in support of coverage without specifying that it would be free. Thus, the claim that Biden supports \"free health care\" for illegal immigrants is misleading.\n\nIn summary, the statement contains several claims that are either misleading or not fully supported by the knowledge provided. The assertion that Biden is for \"open borders\" is false, while the claims about sanctuary cities and free lawyers are not sufficiently addressed. The claim about health care is also misleading as it does not clarify the nature of the coverage.\n\nBased on this analysis, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "Analysis: Fact-checking the CNN Trump-Biden debate | PBS News Support PBS News Your generous monthly contribution\u2014 or whatever you can give\u2014will help secure our future.

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, the presumptive presidential nominees, shared a debate stage June 27 for the first time since 2020, in a feisty confrontation that \u2014 thanks to debate rules \u2014 managed to avoid the near-constant interruptions that marred their previous meetings. CNN hosted the debate , which had no audience, at its Atlanta studio. CNN anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash moderated. The debate format allowed CNN to mute candidates' microphones when it wasn't their turn to speak. READ MORE: 3 key moments from CNN's Biden-Trump debate Trump attacked Biden's record, blaming inflation and other issues on Biden's \"insane and stupid policies.\" Biden questioned Trump's conduct, noting that Trump is a convicted felon and saying he has the \"morals of an alley cat.\" Biden and Trump clashed on topics including immigration, the economy, abortion and their ages. Trump's outlandish immigration claim Trump says Biden \"allowed millions of people to come in here from prisons, jails and mental institutions.\" Pants on Fire! Immigration officials arrested about 103,700 noncitizens with criminal convictions (whether in the U.S. or abroad) from fiscal years 2021 to 2024, federal data shows. That accounts for people stopped at and between ports of entry. Not everyone was let in. The term \"noncitizens\" includes people who may have had legal immigration status in the U.S. but were not U.S. citizens. The data reflects the people that the federal government knows about, but it's inexhaustive. However, immigration experts said despite the data's limitations, there is no evidence to support Trump's statement. Biden's close to the mark about immigration reductions Biden: \"I've changed (the law) in the way that now you're in a situation where there are 40 percent fewer people coming across the border illegally.\" Mostly True.

June 28, 2024 5:00 AM ET Sergio Mart\u00ednez-Beltr\u00e1n Guests at the Old Town Pour House watch a debate between President Biden and former President Donald Trump on Thursday in Chicago. The debate is the first of two scheduled between the two candidates before the November election. Scott Olson/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Scott Olson/Getty Images Without a doubt, the issue of immigration is playing a big role in the 2024 presidential campaign \u2014 and it was certainly one of the main points of contention between President Biden and former President Donald Trump in Thursday night's debate. Trump accused Biden of allowing millions of unauthorized migrants to enter the country. He also said many falsehoods about the current state of immigration. 4 takeaways from the first presidential debate Meanwhile, Biden attempted to explain what he would do to continue lowering the number of migrants crossing illegally, despite that number hitting an all-time high during his tenure. Here are three fact checks of claims made during the debate related to immigration: Claim 1: The U.S. Southern border is open This is a talking point used often by Republicans when referring to Biden\u2019s handling of the U.S.-Mexico border. \u201cHe decided to open up our border, open up our country,\u201d Trump said of Biden during the debate. But this is not accurate. It is true that under Biden, unauthorized crossings hit a record high, oftentimes overwhelming certain border communities and straining its resources . But the border is not \"open.\" In fact, it is arguably more reinforced than ever. The federal government has added more sections of the U.S. Southern border walls, and there have been more military operations at the border. The administration has also increased the number of expedited removals. Biden has tried to work with Congress to overhaul the immigration system, but a majority of Republican lawmakers have not moved forward with the Senate $118 billion border agreement .

Buttigieg : \"Our country is healthier when everybody is healthier. And remember, we\u2019re talking about something people are getting a \u2014 given a chance to buy into. In the same way that there are undocumented immigrants in my community who pay, they pay sales taxes, they pay property taxes directly or indirectly. This is not about a handout. This is an insurance program. And we do ourselves no favor by having 11 million undocumented people in our country be unable to access health care.\" Guthrie then asked Biden to comment. Biden : \"You cannot let \u2014 as the mayor said, you cannot let people who are sick, no matter where they come from, no matter what their status, go uncovered. You can\u2019t do that. It\u2019s just going to be taken care of, period. You have to. It\u2019s the humane thing to do. \"But here\u2019s the deal. The deal is that he\u2019s right about three things. Number one, they in fact contribute to the well-being of the country, but they also \u2014 for example, they\u2019ve increased the lifespan of Social Security because they\u2019re \u2014 they have a job. They\u2019re paying the Social Security tax. That\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s increased the lifespan. They would do the same thing in terms of reducing the overall cost of health care by them being able to be treated and not wait until they\u2019re in extremis.\" No other candidate commented on that question. So all candidates raised their hands affirming they\u2019d have a plan that would offer coverage for immigrants in the country illegally. But the question did not directly ask if coverage would be free. Buttigieg specifically said people would buy the coverage, and that it was \"not about a handout.\" Biden in his answer spoke about the contributions of immigrants in the country illegally \u2014 and said that if they had health care coverage, they\u2019d be reducing the cost of the overall health care system. Our ruling A Trump re-election campaign ad said Democratic presidential candidates \"support giving illegal immigrants free healthcare at our expense.\" This is misleading. The claim is based on a raise-your-hand type of question in a June debate. Candidates were asked if their health care plans would provide coverage for immigrants in the country illegally. All candidates raised their hand. But the question did not ask if the coverage would be for free.\nAP FACT CHECK: Examining claims from the last Trump-Biden debate | PBS News Support PBS News Your generous monthly contribution\u2014 or whatever you can give\u2014will help secure our future.

President Donald Trump's first line of the night, about COVID-19 deaths, was false and set the tone as he and Democratic rival Joe Biden unleashed a torrent of claims in their last presidential debate . Trump misrepresented the reality of the pandemic in myriad and familiar ways, insisting against obvious reality that the pandemic is drawing to a close. He also boasted about \"clean\" facilities at the border for migrant children, ignoring the filthy conditions under which they were held in 2018. Biden, at times, was selective on the coronavirus and other matters, at one point stating that no one under Obamacare lost private health coverage. Millions did. A look at how some of the statements on the stage in Nashville, Tennessee, compared with the facts: CORONAVIRUS TRUMP: \"We're rounding the turn. We're rounding the corner. It's going away.\" THE FACTS: No, the coronavirus isn't going away. It's coming back. New cases are on the rise toward their summer peak. Deaths have also been increasing. According to data through Oct. 21 from Johns Hopkins University, the seven-day rolling average for daily new cases in the U.S. rose over the past two weeks from over 42,300 on Oct. 7 to nearly 60,000 on Oct. 21. In that time the seven-day rolling average for daily new deaths in the U.S. rose from 695 to 757. ___ TRUMP: \"All he does is talk about shutdowns. But forget about him.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical face masks have been recommended as a means of source control for persons who are either symptomatic or asymptomatic to prevent the spread of respiratory droplets produced by coughing or sneezing. The application of medical masks as source control has been shown to decrease the release of respiratory droplets carrying respiratory viruses (Leung et al. , 2020) and they are recommended for the reduction of transmission of influenza (Cheng et al. , 2010; MacIntyre and Chughtai, 2015; MacIntyre et al. , 2015). Medical masks comply with requirements defined in European Standard EN 14683:2019 (European Committee for Standardization, 2019). KN95 with a one-way valve: N95 is an American standard managed by NIOSH, which is part of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). KN95 masks are the equivalent Chinese standard for masks. Both N95 and KN95 correspond to the FFP2 code used in the European Union (European Committee for Standardization, 2001) and protect against solid and liquid irritating aerosols with a minimum filter efficiency of 92%. The mask tested in this work included a one-way exhalation valve that makes it easier to breathe through. This type of mask is not recommended as an effective barrier against the SARS-CoV-2 virus because the valve releases unfiltered air when the wearer breathes out and therefore does not prevent the wearer from spreading the virus. It was included in the study to assess the potential impact of the exhalation valve on the concentration of accumulated carbon dioxide. Cloth masks: Since surgical and FFP2 masks were sometimes difficult to find at the beginning of the pandemic and, especially the FFP2 masks should be reserved for health care providers, cloth masks have become popular during the pandemic as they are cheap, easy to find or to make and can be washed and reused. Cloth masks can be made from common materials, such as sheets made of tightly woven cotton, and should include multiple layers of fabric. There are no standards or regulations for self-made cloth face masks.\nthe precautionary principle requires in such a decision making process, not just the potential benefits. Harms are often under-reported and overlooked while benefits are over interpreted and exaggerated. \u201cCorrectly worn, some types of mask may have an individual benefit for self-protection. Individuals are free to wear one, if they choose. But it is problematic for the state to impose behavioural requirements on citizens without clear scientific evidence of a favourable benefit/harm ratio. Reviews of the available trials on masks have not looked sufficiently at the harms but conclude that there is nil to minimal impact on reducing community transmission. Further mask mandates, whether public or private, are unlikely to have sufficient benefits to be justifiable as public health measures.\" Dr Tom Jefferson, a medically trained epidemiologist, researcher and Cochrane member and campaigner for access to randomised controlled trial data , has been reviewing the evidence of the effects of physical interventions on the spread of viral respiratory infection for two decades: \u201cI echo Robert Dingwall. There is still uncertainty about the effects of face masks. Before the pandemic, clinical trials in widely different settings and using different types of masks showed no clear-cut effect against Influenza-like illnesses (ILI) and influenza and the two available randomised trials of masks conducted on Covid-19, by Bungard et al and Abaluck et al, showed broadly the same conclusions, that masks have no effect against any type of ILI including Covid19. A number of observational studies were carried out after the 2003 SARs-1 epidemic which showed an apparent effect, but higher quality studies failed to confirm that effect. \u201cUntil evidence from large high quality randomised controlled trials is available, we can only conclude with any certainty that there is still uncertainty about the effects of face masks in preventing transmission of respiratory infections. Not an evidence basis for a public health intervention or to reintroduce community or mandated mask wearing over the winter.\u201d Dr Gary Sidley, former NHS consultant clinical psychologist and author has long campaigned about the negative psychological impacts of masks, on children and for many others, the deaf or hard of hearing, abuse victims, PTSD sufferers and more: \u201cMasking the healthy is not and has never been a harmless intervention and mask mandates destroy quality of life. We have never satisfactorily weighed up the social and psychological impact on the millions who seriously struggle to wear masks or interact with others who\nunproven efficacy in disrupting the transmission of respiratory viruses and their adverse social consequences. Introduction Facemasks covering the entrances to the airways were widely mandated during the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, not only for healthcare workers but also for the general population ( 1 ). Professions with frequent human contact were obligated to wear them for long periods as were schoolchildren ( 1 \u2013 6 ). This raises reasonable concerns: first, because use by the general population is associated with a higher risk of improper handling of the mask ( 7 \u2013 11 ); secondly because their efficacy against respiratory viral infections is unproven by high quality trials, which indicate little or no effect ( 12 , 13 ) and thirdly, because masks are assumed only to have positive effects ( 14 \u2013 16 ). In reality there is strong evidence that masks pose various risks, especially for pregnant women, children and adolescents, as well as older adults and the unwell ( 14 , 16 \u2013 19 ). They have several demonstrably adverse effects, affecting physiology ( 14 , 16 , 19 \u2013 23 ), psychology ( 16 , 24 ) and, most obviously, social interactions ( 25 \u2013 35 ). Effects on childhood development are a particular concern. These adverse effects have been recently summarised as the so-called mask-induced exhaustion syndrome MIES ( 14 , 16 , 19 ). Interestingly, Spira ( 36 ) and F\u00f6gen ( 37 ) found significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality rates in the mask-wearing cohorts: explanations are uncertain, but viral trapping and recycling are plausible. A further concern, encompassed within MIES, relates to the potential adverse microbiological consequences of wearing face masks. Owing to the creation of a warm, moist micro-environment ( 38 \u2013 41 ), bacteria, fungi and even viruses may accumulate on both sides of the worn masks ( 42 \u2013 46 ). So far, these aspects have not been evaluated in depth. The aim of our pilot study was to assess, visualise and categorise the general ability of masks to accumulate bacteria when used by the general population. This also with regard to a risk assessment, using worst-case consideration which is necessary in such a protective approach ( 47 ). Accordingly, we undertook a microbiological exploration with random samples of face masks as used by members of the general population, together with a systematic rapid literature review.

Johns said the organization estimates about 28,000 of its current members could take part in such a plan, many of whom are farmers who buy their own health insurance. But anyone can join the Iowa Farm Bureau if they pay annual dues of $55 or less, making the option available to almost anyone in the state. Currently, Medica is the only insurance provider in Iowa's individual marketplace, which is where about 46,500 Iowans purchase health insurance if they are not offered it through their employer or through a government program. That's down from about 72,000 last year. About 41,700 of Medica's Iowa customers have incomes low enough to qualify for Affordable Care Act subsidies, which help pay their health-insurance premiums. The new Farm Bureau plans would not qualify for such subsidies. A national expert said the consumers most likely to benefit from the proposal are young, healthy Iowans who make too much money to qualify for Affordable Care Act subsidies. \"I think the people who would really get nailed here are the people who are older or have pre-existing conditions \u2014 and who don't qualify for the subsidies,\" said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University Health Policy Institute in Washington, D.C. Iowa's Farm Bureau for years partnered with Wellmark to market health-insurance plans before the Affordable Care Act was passed under President Barack Obama. Corlette noted that the Farm Bureau in Tennessee has continued to sell old-style health insurance , despite the Affordable Care Act. Pre-existing health conditions are considered when premiums are set for those plans. The Tennessee arrangement skirts Affordable Care Act regulations, which apply to state-regulated health insurance. Tennessee exempted the Farm Bureau plans from its state regulations, and Iowa's proposal would do the same thing, Corlette noted. Corlette said Tennesseeans who buy the Farm Bureau coverage have had to pay federal penalties, because their policies don't qualify as full health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, which requires most Americans to have insurance. However, the Trump administration has decided to no longer force Americans to pay such penalties, so Iowans who buy the new Farm Bureau plans would not face such a barrier."}], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 1, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.4}

Some states have implemented bans on specific types of alcohol packaging, including sachets and polythene bags, due to concerns about public health and safety.\n\n2. **Sachet Alcohol**: The sale of alcoholic beverages in sachets has been a contentious issue in Nigeria. The government has expressed concerns that sachet alcohol is often consumed irresponsibly and can lead to health issues.\n\n3. **Polythene Packaging**: Similar to sachets, polythene packaging for alcohol has also faced scrutiny. The government has aimed to regulate these forms of packaging to mitigate health risks and control the consumption of alcohol.\n\n4. **Implementation of Bans**: While there have been discussions and proposals regarding bans on sachet and polythene alcohol, the enforcement and scope of these bans can vary by region. Some states have indeed enacted such bans, while others may not have done so uniformly.\n\nBased on these points, the statement appears to be accurate in that there have been bans on alcohol in sachet and polythene in certain areas of Nigeria.

This suggests a significant atmospheric phenomenon or event that would cause such a dramatic change in sky color.\n\n2. **Possible Causes for Sky Color Change**: \n   - Natural phenomena such as wildfires can cause the sky to appear orange or red due to smoke particles scattering sunlight.\n   - Atmospheric conditions, such as sunsets or sunrises, can also create vibrant colors in the sky.\n   - Pollution or dust storms can lead to similar effects.\n\n3. **Recent Events**: \n   - There have been instances in recent years where wildfires, particularly in the western United States, have caused the sky to appear orange or red due to smoke.\n   - Additionally, there are reports of unusual atmospheric conditions leading to vibrant sky colors.\n\n4. **Geographical Scope**: The statement mentions \"several parts of the United States,\" which is broad but plausible given the occurrence of wildfires and other atmospheric phenomena in various states.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the context of recent wildfires and atmospheric conditions that can lead to such color changes in the sky, the statement is plausible and aligns with known events.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the statement is accurate.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"True\"\n}\n```", "answer": "True"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [], "source": "rag_only_forced"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 0, "concluded_by_rag": false, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.4}

However, some organizations can have different types of tax-exempt status or special tax considerations.\n\n2. **NFL, NBA, and MLB**: \n   - The NFL (National Football League) is a professional American football league. It was previously classified as a tax-exempt organization but changed its status in 2015 to a taxable entity.\n   - The NBA (National Basketball Association) is a professional basketball league. It operates as a for-profit entity and does not have tax-exempt status.\n   - MLB (Major League Baseball) is a professional baseball league. Similar to the NFL, it was previously classified as a tax-exempt organization but has also changed its status to a taxable entity.\n\n3. **Current Status**: As of the latest information, none of these leagues (NFL, NBA, MLB) hold tax-exempt status.

This is a serious and controversial assertion that would likely have significant public and legal implications.\n\n2. **Knowledge Context**: The provided knowledge does not contain any information about Ginsburg making such a statement. Instead, it focuses on Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court and her comments about Ginsburg.

Since then, Nigeria has experienced several military coups and periods of military governance interspersed with civilian rule.\n\n2. **Military Rule Timeline**:\n   - **First Republic (1960-1966)**: Nigeria was under civilian rule until the first military coup in January 1966.\n   - **Military Rule (1966-1979)**: Following the coup, Nigeria was under military rule until the return to civilian governance in 1979.\n   - **Second Republic (1979-1983)**: This period of civilian rule ended with another military coup in December 1983.\n   - **Military Rule (1983-1999)**: Nigeria was again under military rule until the transition to civilian rule in May 1999.\n\n3. **Calculating Military Rule Duration**:\n   - From 1966 to 1979: Approximately 13 years.\n   - From 1983 to 1999: Approximately 16 years.\n   - Total military rule duration: 13 + 16 = 29 years.\n\n4. **Current Context**: As of October 2023, Nigeria has been a nation for 63 years (from 1960 to 2023). The statement claims that Nigeria has been under military rule for a cumulative 29 of its 60 years of existence. \n\n5. **Verification of the Statement**: \n   - The total years of military rule (29 years) is accurate based on the historical timeline.\n   - However, the statement mentions \"60 years of existence,\" which is incorrect as Nigeria has existed for 63 years since independence.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement is misleading because it inaccurately states the number of years Nigeria has existed as a nation. \n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "Special Anti-Robbery Squad - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Former Nigerian police unit This article appears to be slanted towards recent events .

Our country has experienced both the good and the bad times in its 65 years of nationhood, as is normal for every nation and its people. We fought a bitter and avoidable civil war, experienced military dictatorships, and lived through major political crises. In all these, we weathered every storm and overcame every challenge with courage, grit, and uncommon determination. While our system and ties that bind us are sometimes stretched by insidious forces opposed to our values and ways of life, we continue to strive to build a more perfect union where every Nigerian can find better accommodation and find purpose and fulfilment. 6. Fellow Compatriots, this is the third time I will address you on our independence anniversary since I assumed office as your President on May 29, 2023. In the last 28 months of my administration, like our founding fathers and leaders who came before me, I have committed myself irrevocably to the unfinished nation-building business. 7. Upon assuming office, our administration inherited a near-collapsed economy caused by decades of fiscal policy distortions and misalignment that had impaired real growth. As a new administration, we faced a simple choice: continue business as usual and watch our nation drift, or embark on a courageous, fundamental reform path. We chose the path of reform. We chose the path of tomorrow over the comfort of today. Less than three years later, the seeds of those difficult but necessary decisions are bearing fruit. 8. In resetting our country for sustainable growth, we ended the corrupt fuel subsidies and multiple foreign exchange rates that created massive incentives for a rentier economy, benefiting only a tiny minority. At the same time, the masses received little or nothing from our Commonwealth. Our administration has redirected the economy towards a more inclusive path, channelling money to fund education, healthcare, national security, agriculture, and critical economic infrastructure, such as roads, power, broadband, and social investment programmes. These initiatives will generally improve Nigerians\u2019 quality of life. As a result of the tough decisions we made, the Federal and State governments, including Local Governments, now have more resources to take care of the people at the lower level of the ladder, to address our development challenges. 9.

If you already submitted a mail-in or absentee ballot, you cannot vote at your polling place on Election Day. If you did not return your mail-in or absentee ballot and you want to vote in person, you have two options: Bring your ballot and the pre-addressed outer return envelope to your polling place to be voided. After you surrender your ballot and envelope and sign a declaration, you can then vote a regular ballot. If you don't surrender your ballot and return envelope, you can only vote by provisional ballot at your polling place. Your county election board will then verify that you did not vote by mail before counting your provisional ballot. How do I know if my ballot was accepted and counted? You can track the status of your ballot online . If you provide your email address to your county election office at the time you register to vote or apply for a mail ballot, you may receive an email notification when your returned ballot is received, as well as information about your ballot status, depending on county practices. You can call your county elections office for more information. Why are there two envelopes with my mail-in ballot?

The lawsuit argues that mail-in ballots should have to be only postmarked \u2014 not received \u2014 by 7 p.m. on Election Day. Kirk Nielsen, one of 10 plaintiffs in the case, says the fate of a ballot is out of a voter's hands once it goes in the mail. His was one of thousands of ballots rejected in the state in 2018. Nielsen says he mailed it eight days before Election Day, but it was not received until eight days after. He worries about being disenfranchised again. 2020 Election: Secure Your Vote This November, Election Night Could Stretch Into Election Week Or Month \"I want to vote by mail this year because of the pandemic. I don't want to get sick at a crowded polling place and I don't want to contribute to spreading the virus by going to a crowded polling place, but that said, I think there's an even greater risk this year voting by mail that my mail ballot might not be counted, along with thousands of others,\" Nielsen says. His case is scheduled to be heard this month, but Republicans were heartened by the judge's refusal to issue a preliminary injunction against the state's mail-in rules. The judge said the Election Day receipt deadline \"eliminates the problem of missing, unclear, or even altered postmarks, eliminates delay that can have adverse consequences, and eliminates the remote possibility that in an extremely close election \u2014 Florida has had some \u2014 a person who did not vote on or before Election Day can fill out and submit a ballot later.\" These are all arguments that Republicans have made in defense of keeping the Election Day deadline currently in place in most states. 2020 Election: Secure Your Vote Chaos In Primary Elections Raises Fears For November \"Allowing massive amounts of ballots to arrive or the counting to continue well after Election Day really allows room for fraud,\" says Mandi Merritt, national press secretary for the Republican National Committee. \"It allows losing candidates or other partisan operatives to go find more late votes that could potentially change the legitimate outcome of an election and really just leaves room for unnecessary litigation.\" While Merritt did not offer an example, she says even the possibility of fraud would undermine\nregistered voter will receive a ballot in the mail for the upcoming election. However, five of those states (Colorado, Oregon, Utah, Hawaii and Washington) have been holding their elections primarily by mail since before the pandemic, so voters who register in these states do so knowing they\u2019ll likely submit their ballot by mail.

The five places that changed their policies for this election to send ballots to all voters \u2013 DC , California , Vermont, Nevada and New Jersey \u2013 have at least 29 million registered voters by the latest available count. Based on this data, the number of truly unsolicited ballots sent out is at most, around half of what the President claims, and likely even less. It\u2019s also worth noting that even in the unsolicited instances, states have safeguards in place to prevent the kind of fraud Trump implies will result from the projected increase in voting by mail this election.

The pandemic this year has raised concerns about large groups of voters gathering indoors, so some additional states \u2014 California, Nevada, New Jersey, Vermont plus Washington, D.C. \u2014 have decided to send ballots to all active voters. In other states, voters have to take action to request a mail ballot, though some of them took that step already if they live in a state that allows a permanent absentee voting list that may be offered to all voters, or only to certain voters based on specific criteria such as age or disability. We asked the Trump campaign to show how it arrived at 80 million unsolicited ballots, and whether that included a handful of states that have generally held all vote-by-mail elections for years. We did not receive a response. It\u2019s possible that Trump or an aide saw a prediction in an August New York Times article that \"80 million mail ballots will flood election offices this fall.\" However, that figure isn\u2019t limited to voters who will be sent \"unsolicited\" ballots. It includes voters who will have to request a mail ballot. The New York Times found that ballots will be mailed directly to about 44 million voters in nine states and D.C. So that\u2019s a little more than half of the figure Trump cited. WRAL partners with PolitiFact NC to fact check political stories University of Florida political scientist Michael McDonald found a similar total number of ballots \u2014 44.4 million \u2014 that will be sent in states conducting all-mail elections. He also counted Montana, where Gov. Steve Bullock used his emergency powers to allow counties to opt in to holding an all-mail election. As of late August, most Montana counties opted for all mail. Paul Gronke, an expert on voting by mail at Reed College, predicted somewhere north of 80 million ballots will be cast by mail, double 2016\u2019s total. In D.C. and the states that decided to send ballots to all voters this year due to the pandemic, many of those voters would have likely requested a ballot anyway or were on permanent absentee-ballot lists. For example, in California in 2016, there were 13 million ballots cast, including 7 million absentee.

By Linda Qiu July 14, 2014 Red foxes may roam all over Canada but you won\u2019t catch the conservative news network there, according to an Internet meme circulating since 2011. One version of the meme states that Fox New Channel is \"banned from operating in Canada\" because \"it\u2019s illegal in Canada to lie on airwaves.\" A reader sent the message to us and asked us to check it out. A mountie of lies We weren\u2019t able to verify the origins of the meme, though Bill O\u2019Reilly himself said in 2004 that Fox wasn\u2019t allowed in Canada -- not that he agreed with the lying part. The earliest iteration of the full claim we found comes from a Feb. 28, 2011, Huffington Post blog post by liberal radio host and activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \"The (false news) provision has kept Fox News and right wing talk radio out of Canada and helped make Canada a model for liberal democracy and freedom,\" wrote Kennedy. \"As a result of that law, Canadians enjoy high-quality news coverage including the kind of foreign affairs and investigative journalism that flourished in this country before Ronald Reagan abolished the \u2018Fairness Doctrine\u2019 in 1987.\" What Kennedy is likely referring to are provisions in Canadian broadcast policy, include the Radio Act and other policies, that prohibit \"any false or misleading news.\" These provisions against spreading misinformation used to be part of Canada\u2019s criminal code, according to Canadian media lawyer Paul Schabas. They were famously evoked to send Holocaust denier and neo-Nazi publisher Ernst Z\u00fcndel to trial in the 1980s. After the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that the code violated freedom of expression rights and thus was unconstitutional, the false news provisions were just regulations.

We will repeal the Hyde Amendment, and protect and codify the right to reproductive freedom. You could ask the person you\u2019re dialoguing with, does that wording sound like they want to reduce abortion, or in fact increase access to it? Why would Planned Parenthood promote, endorse, and financially support certain candidates, unless they knew that it would be financially beneficial for them to see those candidates win their elections? Randy writes, \u201cUnfortunately, any support of the abortion industry, which has no financial interest in keeping abortion rare\u2014in fact, quite the opposite\u2014only bolsters it.\u201d Notice that the Democratic party platform says nothing about keeping abortion rare; only \u201csafe\u201d and \u201clegal.\u201d (Compare this with the Republican platform .) To summarize: on the one hand, we have the good news that the abortion rate is continuing to decrease over time, and that the occupant of the White House isn\u2019t the only important factor when it comes to abortion rates. We know that the pro-life movement is making a big difference. On the other hand, we can\u2019t say that the abortion policies of the President don\u2019t matter; they do have power to set the course and direction of our country, impact state policies, and to either discourage or encourage the abortion industry. (And of course, there is also the presidential appointment of judges, and the effects of policies on pro-life ministries and organizations.) Hope this provides some helpful thoughts.

When individuals support a political party, it does not automatically mean their employer follows suit. Bethania Palma Published Aug. 19, 2020 Updated Aug. 20, 2020 Image courtesy of Ruslan Ivantsov / Shutterstock Claim: A portion of what members and/or donors pay to AARP (formerly American Association of Retired Persons) goes directly to the U.S. Democratic party. Rating: False About this rating In mid-August 2020, Snopes readers inquired about a meme circulating on Facebook that claimed money given to AARP (formerly American Association of Retired Persons), an advocacy organization that lobbies on behalf of retired Americans, goes \"directly\" to the Democratic party. It's unclear what exactly is meant by the phrase, \"what you pay AARP.\" The organization has an estimated 38 million members, all of whom typically pay annual dues at $16 per year. As a 501(c)4 tax-exempt organization, it also accepts charitable donations. Either way, any money paid to AARP through membership dues or donations does not go \"directly\" to the Democratic party. The AARP lobbies the government on behalf of causes that affect people aged 50 and older. Those activities may include taking a stand on health care and Social Security . In terms of candidates and political parties, however, AARP's official position is that it is non-partisan. The organization states it \"does not support, endorse or contribute to political candidates or parties.\" Instead, per AARP, the organization's role in terms of election politics is \"connecting voters to information about where the candidates stand on issues most important to them including the future of Social Security and other critical issues related to financial security, health and well-being.\" We checked the AARP's federal campaign finance data using the website Open Secrets , a project operated by the government accountability organization The Center for Responsive Politics. We found no contributions to any political candidates or parties, Democratic or otherwise, from AARP, the organization. However, contributions from individuals who work for AARP is another matter. \"AARP does not have any record of direct contributions to political parties or candidates based on my review of federal campaign finance and tax filings covering recent years,"}], "source": "rag_only"}, "rag_context": {"retrieved_count": 5, "concluded_by_rag": true, "web_retrieval_disabled": true}, "train_ratio": 0.4}

This suggests that a significant majority of people who contract COVID-19 do not die from it.\n\n2. **Hospitalization and Severity**: The data from the CDC shows that a substantial number of patients were hospitalized (14%) and a smaller percentage (2%) were admitted to intensive care units. This indicates that while many recover, a notable portion experiences severe illness.\n\n3. **Long-term Effects**: The knowledge also mentions that some individuals experience lingering symptoms, which implies that recovery can vary in terms of health outcomes, even if the person is not hospitalized or does not die.\n\n4. **General Recovery Rates**: While the knowledge does not provide a specific recovery rate, the implication from the infection fatality rate suggests that a high percentage of individuals do recover from COVID-19, potentially supporting the claim that 99% recover.\n\n5. **Contextual Understanding**: The statement does not specify the context of \"recovery\" (e.g., full recovery, mild symptoms, etc.), which is important because some individuals may recover from the acute phase of the illness but still experience long-term effects.\n\nBased on the information provided, while the exact percentage of recovery is not explicitly stated, the data supports the idea that a very high percentage of people do recover from COVID-19, likely close to or above 99%.

Based on several studies in various countries, the World Health Organization\u2019s chief scientist, Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, said on July 2 that the infection fatality rate is about 0.6% \u2014 at least for now, according to the New York Times . Jha said he thinks the rate \u201cshould come down over time because we\u2019re getting better at treating COVID.\u201d \u201cAnd so somebody who spends three weeks in the ICU, has severe lung damage and would have died two months ago might now survive,\u201d he said. \u201cBut let\u2019s be very clear, that if you spent three weeks in the ICU, have severe, diffuse lung damage and you survive, it\u2019s fabulous that you survived. That was not inconsequential.\u201d Even if the infection fatality rate is about 1%, that\u2019s \u201cstill a lot of people,\u201d Dr. Lee Riley , professor and chair of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told us. \u201c I\u2019m more concerned about the actual numbers of people who are dying rather than the percent.\u201d As of July 6, that figure was 130,208 deaths in the United States , according to Johns Hopkins\u2019 figures. \u201cWhatever the proportion, we\u2019ve had over 130,000 deaths in the US so far,\u201d Morse, at Columbia University, said, \u201cmore than twice as many as died in the Vietnam War, and more than died in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan combined, but I don\u2019t think war could be called \u201899% harmless\u2019.\u201d McEnany said in the July 6 press briefing that Trump\u2019s claim was a reference to \u201cthe fact that mortality in this country is very low.\u201d And the case \u201cfatality rate in this country, vis-a-vis other European countries, is much lower than, let\u2019s say, France and Italy.\u201d The U.S., at 4.5%, does have a lower case fatality rate than France (14.6%) and Italy (14.4%), as well as other countries, but a higher rate than many countries, too. But McEnany\u2019s explanation doesn\u2019t support what Trump said, in claiming 99% of coronavirus cases are \u201ctotally harmless.\u201d In addition to those who die, many are hospitalized. In June, the CDC published data on the 1.3 million reported cases in the U.S. from Jan. 22 to May 30, finding: \u201cOverall, 184,673 (14%) patients were hospitalized, 29,837 (2%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and\nand Infectious Diseases, did not blunder, correctly stating what was known at that time about the ratio of fatalities to cases of both seasonal flu and COVID-19.\u201d Their full review can be read here . Another organisation, Full Fact, has questioned the claim in Malcolm Kendrick\u2019s article that Covid-19 kills no more than 0.1 percent of people. It asserts that this is incorrect and that the \u201creal death rate is probably about five or ten times higher.\u201d They argue: \u201cAlthough it is difficult to know exactly how many people have caught Covid-19, or died from it, there have been a number of studies that have attempted to estimate the death rate. So far they tend to produce rates between 0.5% and 1%. \u201cLooking at English data, it is clear that the death rate must be much higher than the claimed 0.1%. Researchers who conducted a survey (the REACT-2 survey) by testing blood from a sample of the population, to see how many have Covid-19 antibodies, produced a detailed analysis that estimates an overall death rate of about 0.9%. \u201cThe RT article says there were around 40,00 Covid deaths in the UK \u2013 the actual figure is at least 44,400 in England alone, up to 30 June. If the death rate was 0.1% then some 44.4 million people \u2013 or 79% of the population in England \u2013 would have had to have caught Covid by early June. No reasonable estimate gets close to this figure.\u201d Their full analysis can be read here . Also on rt.com Weird science: Covid-19 does NOT cause heart damage, as blockbuster study had basic calculation errors When you strip everything else out, the reason for lockdown comes from a single figure: one percent. This was the prediction that Covid, if left unchecked, would kill around one percent of us. You may not think that percentage is enormous, but one percent of the population of the world is 70 million people \u2013 and that\u2019s a lot. It would mean 3.2 million Americans dead, and 670,000 Britons. But where did this one-percent figure come from? To find out we have to go back to what happened when the virus first began showing up at the beginning of the year. As cases started to mount, on February 28, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the immunologist who heads up the US Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and some colleagues published a\nheart disease, cancer and unintentional injury, respectively, which is unchanged from 2022. Last year marked the first time since the pandemic began that COVID-19 was not one of the top five leading causes of death. Provisional data showed COVID-19 was the underlying cause for 1.6% of all deaths in 2023, decreasing from 5.7% in 2022. MORE: Why are 1,500 Americans still dying from COVID every week? The COVID-19 death rate fell from 58.7 per 100,000 deaths in 2022 to 18.2 per 100,000 in 2023, the report found.

Death rates from COVID-19 were highest among those aged 75 and older -- highlighting the impact the virus has had on the elderly population. However, the gap between death rates among racial/ethnic groups shrunk from 2022 to 2023. In 2022, the COVID death rate for white Americans was 58.6 per 100,000 compared to 71.0 per 100,000 for Black Americans. In 2023, the rate was 19.6 per 100,000 for white Americans and 17 per 100,000 for Black Americans.

The installation commemorates all the Americans who have died due to COVID-19, a concept by artist Suzanne Brennan Firstenberg, includes more than 650,000 small plastic flags, some with personal messages to those who have died, planted in 20 acres of the National Mall. Kent Nishimura/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images \"Because of the wide disparities that exist in COVID-related deaths, and we know that COVID deaths were not equal across the population, especially hit\u2026Black populations and other and African American people, it's not surprising that when you overall reduce COVID deaths, that will overall contribute to potentially sort of a closing of the gap,\" Brownstein said. He added that there is more work to be done to close the gap even further, including providing access to health care and insurance for traditionally underserved populations.

The latter category included \u201crespiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure.\u201d The WHO also says that 13.8% of confirmed coronavirus patients have severe disease and 6.1% have critical cases. Beyond the harm caused by being sick and hospitalized, there are the financial ramifications of that treatment, the impact on hospitals of the pandemic and the burden to the U.S. health system, Riley said. And even those who have mild symptoms may transmit the infection to others. \u201cThey can still pass it on to others, who may get sick or even (tragically) die,\u201d Morse said. Lingering and Long-Term Effects Not much is known about how frequently COVID-19 patients suffer long-term effects, but there are signs that the disease does not always completely resolve itself as rapidly as expected \u2014 and is unlikely to be described as \u201charmless\u201d by many who are affected. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any long-term data because the virus has only been around for a little while,\u201d said Harvard\u2019s Jha. \u201cBut we certainly are seeing more and more cases of people with \u2026 lingering symptoms.\u201d According to the WHO, it takes about two weeks for a person to recover from a mild case of COVID-19, and three to six weeks to recover from a severe or critical one. Anecdotally, however, some patients \u2014 even those with mild cases \u2014 report months of extreme fatigue or on-and-off again symptoms such as headaches , brain fog or shortness of breath that make daily life difficult.

On December 18, 1972, Neilia Biden and infant daughter Naomi were killed in a car accident while on the way to pick out a Christmas tree . Hunter and his elder brother, Joseph Robinette (\u201c Beau \u201d) Biden III, who was known as Beau in the family, were critically injured. Among other injuries, Hunter suffered a broken skull and brain injuries. Joe Biden, who had been elected to the U.S. Senate six weeks earlier, took the oath of office in his sons\u2019 hospital room. In 1977 Joe Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs , who became Hunter and Beau\u2019s stepmother. Jill and Joe Biden have a daughter, Ashley Blazer Biden, who was born in 1981. Hunter Biden attended Archmere Academy, a Roman Catholic high school in Claymont, Delaware, following in the footsteps of his father and elder brother. He spent his first year of college at the University of Pennsylvania , then enrolled in Georgetown University in 1988, where he graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in history in 1992. After graduation, he moved on to Portland , Oregon , and he served in the Jesuit Volunteer Corps , where he met Kathleen Buhle. Three months into their relationship, Buhle became pregnant; the two were married in July 1993, and their daughter Naomi King Biden was born in December.

The law also capped the out-of-pocket price for insulin that\u2019s covered under Medicare Part B, which covers drugs administered in a health care provider\u2019s office. The caps went into effect last year. STAT, a news site that covers health care issues, reported that the idea for a $35 cap for seniors initially came from Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical company, which proposed it in 2019.

That doesn\u2019t jibe with anything Biden has proposed. In his more than three years as president, Biden\u2019s major tax changes have included setting a minimum corporate tax rate of 15% and lowering taxes for some families by expanding the child tax credit and, for a time, making it fully refundable, meaning families could still receive a refund even if they no longer owe additional taxes. As we wrote in 2020, when Trump made a similar claim, Biden proposed during that campaign to raise an additional $4 trillion in taxes over the next decade, although the increases would have fallen mainly on very high-income earners and corporations. The plan would not have doubled or tripled people\u2019s taxes at any income level (on average), according to analyses of Biden\u2019s plan by the Penn Wharton Budget Model , the Tax Policy Center and the Tax Foundation .

In his 2021 memoir, Hunter said he felt the unresolved trauma both he and his brother dealt with after the accident in 1972 \u201cmanifested themselves differently in each of us,\u201d for the rest of their lives. To blame it for his own substance abuse battles would be a \u201ccop-out,\u201d he wrote, but added later that it took him decades \u201cto acknowledge that original loss, address that original trauma, recognize that original pain.\u201d Reflecting on grief recently in an interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, Joe Biden said that as difficult as losing Beau was for him, it \u201cwas even more profound for Hunter\u201d and his daughter, Ashley. \u201cIt made me a little more fatalistic. It also caused me and Jill enormous pain because he should be the one sitting there talking to you, Beau. He was a better man than I am, and so is Hunter,\u201d Joe Biden said.

Biden went a step further Wednesday, by ordering a moratorium on new oil and gas leases on federal land and water areas. However, this is a far cry from the more dramatic step climate activists are calling for (and that the oil industry fears): a full-blown federal ban on fracking. \u201cLet me be clear, and I know this always comes up.

The magazine has faced significant backlash, particularly from Muslim communities, for its portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad.\n\n2. **Key Points from the Knowledge**:\n   - Charlie Hebdo has a history of publishing controversial cartoons that many Muslims find offensive, particularly those depicting the Prophet Muhammad.\n   - The magazine's actions have sparked debates about freedom of expression versus respect for religious beliefs.\n   - The statement implies a broader narrative of hostility from Western political and cultural institutions towards Islam and Muslims, which is a complex and debated topic.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Claim**: The statement claims that the actions of Charlie Hebdo reveal a \"hatred and hostility\" from Western institutions towards Islam. While it is true that the magazine's actions have been perceived as offensive by many Muslims, the characterization of this as a \"cardinal and unforgivable sin\" is subjective and reflects a particular viewpoint. \n\n4. **Cultural and Political Context**: The relationship between Western institutions and Islam is multifaceted. While there are instances of discrimination and hostility, there are also many efforts within Western societies to promote understanding and coexistence.

We can\u2019t all hope to become president, but Biden\u2019s story is instructive. Here are a few lessons the average person can take away from it. Henglein and Steets / Getty Images Building Wealth Takes Time First, consider how long it took for Biden to become a millionaire. He began his career in 1968 and likely didn\u2019t reach\n2014, collecting an average of $250,000 per appearance \u2014 including before major corporations like Goldman Sachs. Sensitive to the complaints Clinton faced as she tried to keep some of her speeches private, the Biden campaign made a point of saying that more than half his speaking engagements were open to the media. According to Biden\u2019s financial reports, his speaking fees were as high as $234,820 in one case. When Biden gave a lecture at Drew University in New Jersey in March 2018, he was paid $190,000. A couple of weeks later, he was paid $180,000 to speak at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. A Biden campaign official said the large speaking fees from universities came from special funds not linked to school tuition. Still, large fees from schools could be an issue at a time Biden and other candidates have made the rapid rise in the cost of attending college a major campaign issue. Biden may have avoided some of the landmines that hurt Clinton. While the details provided on the financial disclosures are vague for some of his events, there do not appear to be any checks collected from Wall Street investment banks or other big corporate interests.

Their charitable donations rose with their income: In 2016, the Bidens gave 1.5% of their income to charity; in 2017, they gave 9.2%; and in 2018, they donated 6%. Sizeable chunks of their donations went to nonprofits named for the Bidens. Of the $1 million the Bidens donated to charity in 2017, $100,000 went to the Joseph Biden Foundation Community Legal Aid Society Inc., and $150,000 went to the Beau Biden Foundation for the Protection of Children, an organization named for Biden\u2019s son, who died of brain cancer in 2015. An additional $55,000 went to Biden-related charities in 2018. Also in 2018, the Bidens reported a $25,000 contribution to the International Assn. of Firefighters Foundation. The group found a way to thank him: When Biden launched his campaign earlier this year, the firefighters union was the first to endorse him.\nbegun feeling wealthy. The average U.S. wage was under $20,000 throughout the period. Joe earned over three times that for most of the decade, which doesn\u2019t account for Jill\u2019s income. The family had enough to contribute a significant amount to savings every year. Their net worth likely went up substantially during this period because of that. But although Joe earned a good salary, the Bidens probably still weren\u2019t millionaires at this point. \u00a9Shutterstock.com June 1987: Announces Candidacy for Presidency Joe Biden first revealed his ambitions for the White House in 1987 and announced his candidacy. He sought the Democratic nomination, but was unsuccessful, losing to Michael Dukakis. Biden was thought of as a \u201cbright new hope\u201d in the Democratic party. However, a video surfaced of him plagiarizing another politician without attribution. That may sound like a relatively minor scandal by today\u2019s standards. But it was a big deal in 1987. Soon after, reporters discovered that Biden graduated near the bottom of his law school class. He got a reputation for being a candidate with style but not substance, and he dropped out of the race. The future president also had a health scare this year. He had to have surgery to fix two brain aneurysms. In typical Biden fashion, he didn\u2019t allow the health scare to derail him from his goals.

He started the 1990s earning $98,400 and ended his time in the Senate earning $165,200 in 2007. During this period, Biden also taught at Widener University on the side, earning about $20,000 annually. His wife Jill taught English at Delaware Technical Community College, a role that paid her around $60,000 per year. All in all, the family was earning around $230,000 annually by the early 2000s. Some years they made more, such as in 2005, when they earned an additional $81,250 from a literary agency. Biden and his wife purchased their Delaware home during this era, too. The couple paid $350,000 for a four-acre lot in New Castle County, building a 6,850-square-foot home. We can\u2019t say for certain, but this is likely when the Biden family became net-worth millionaires. The property and completed home may have been worth close\n1972: Elected to U.S. Senate, Earns $42,500 Annually Biden\u2019s career in the federal government started with his election to the U.S. Senate in 1972. He earned $42,500 that first year. That may not sound like much, but it\u2019s over $300,000 in today\u2019s dollars. Tragically, Biden\u2019s joy at being elected to the Senate was short-lived. His wife and three children were in a car crash while Christmas shopping the month after he was elected. He lost his wife, Neilia, and daughter Naomi, but his sons Beau and Hunter recovered. The incident profoundly impacted Biden, which he\u2019s spoken openly about throughout his life. For instance, in 2020, he said , \u201cThere\u2019s a reason to grieve. You\u2019ve had great loss. But there will come a time \u2026 when you\u2019ll think of your [loved one] and you\u2019ll get a smile to your lips before you get a tear to your eye.\u201d Trending Now: How Much Is President Joe Biden Worth as He Seeks Reelection? SrdjanPav / iStock.com June 1977: Marries Jill Tracy Jacobs, Earns $57,500 Annually Biden married his second and current wife, Jill Tracy Jacobs, five years after the accident, in 1977. He also got a raise that year when U.S. senator salaries increased to $57,500. Story Continues From this point forward, the Biden household has two incomes. However, as a schoolteacher, Jill Biden likely didn\u2019t earn very much. This means the new couple\u2019s net worth was probably still relatively low. monkeybusinessimages / iStock.com 1978 \u2013 1987: Biden Establishes Himself, Gets Several Raises Biden won re-election to the U.S. Senate two times between 1978 and 1987 [ 1 ]. He also became a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and then the Senate Judiciary Committee. Over these years, the salary for U.S. senators gradually increased. Here\u2019s what Biden earned on an annual basis during the period: 1978 : $57,500 1979 \u2013 1983 : $60,662.50 1983 : $69,800 1984 : $72,600 1985 \u2013 1986 : $75,100 1987 : 89,500 There are no official estimates of the Biden family\u2019s net worth at this time. However, this is around the point when they may have begun feeling wealthy. The average U.S. wage was under $20,000 throughout the period. Joe earned over three times that for most of the decade, which doesn\u2019t account for Jill\u2019s income. The family had enough to contribute a significant amount to savings every year. Their net worth likely went up substantially\nfor US exports of motor vehicles and refined petroleum products (e.g., gasoline), which are among the fastest-growing U.S. exports to Africa. Agricultural products and machinery, the research group said, are other top US exports to the country, adding that Nigeria\u2019s demand also has driven growing U.S. petroleum exports to nearby Togo, a regional transhipment hub. On the US foreign assistance globally, the document noted that the USAID allocated $451.4 million in bilateral aid for Nigeria in FY2020, nearly 90 per cent of which supported health programmes.

In a speech delivered from Wilmington in his home state of Delaware, Biden unveiled the most ambitious clean energy and environmental justice plans ever proposed by the nominee of a major American political party. The plans, which the Biden campaign described to reporters as \u201cthe legislation he goes up to [Capitol Hill] immediately to get done,\u201d outline $2tn in investments in clean energy, jobs and infrastructure that would be carried out over the four years of his first term. Forty percent of these investments would be directed to communities of color living on the toxic edge of the fossil fuel economy \u2013 communities that have also been among the most devastated by the coronavirus pandemic.

President Donald Trump's first line of the night, about COVID-19 deaths, was false and set the tone as he and Democratic rival Joe Biden unleashed a torrent of claims in their last presidential debate . Trump misrepresented the reality of the pandemic in myriad and familiar ways, insisting against obvious reality that the pandemic is drawing to a close. He also boasted about \"clean\" facilities at the border for migrant children, ignoring the filthy conditions under which they were held in 2018. Biden, at times, was selective on the coronavirus and other matters, at one point stating that no one under Obamacare lost private health coverage. Millions did. A look at how some of the statements on the stage in Nashville, Tennessee, compared with the facts: CORONAVIRUS TRUMP: \"We're rounding the turn. We're rounding the corner. It's going away.\" THE FACTS: No, the coronavirus isn't going away. It's coming back. New cases are on the rise toward their summer peak. Deaths have also been increasing. According to data through Oct. 21 from Johns Hopkins University, the seven-day rolling average for daily new cases in the U.S. rose over the past two weeks from over 42,300 on Oct. 7 to nearly 60,000 on Oct. 21.

The Democrat outpaced President-elect Donald Trump by almost 2.9 million votes, with 65,844,954 (48.2%) to his 62,979,879 (46.1%), according to revised and certified final election results from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Clinton\u2019s 2.1% margin ranks third among defeated candidates, according to statistics from US Elections\nthe election to either candidate. This election marked the first time since 1948 that the Democratic Party won the popular vote in four consecutive elections. Trump refused to accept the results; he and his allies made disproven claims of fraud, pressured elections officials, filed several unsuccessful lawsuits, [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] and directly attempted to overturn the results at the county, state, and federal level. This culminated in the attack on the United States Capitol , an attempted self-coup , on January 6, 2021, for which Trump was impeached a second time . The day after the attack, Trump stated that a \"new administration\" would be succeeding his, without mentioning president-elect Biden by name, in a video posted on Twitter . [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Background Further information: United States presidential election \u00a7 Procedure The incumbent in 2020, Donald Trump . His first term expired at noon on January 20, 2021. The Maine Legislature passed a bill in August 2019 adopting ranked-choice voting (RCV) both for presidential primaries and for the general election. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] Governor Janet Mills allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed its taking effect until after the 2020 Democratic primary in March and made Maine the first state to use RCV for a presidential general election. The Maine Republican Party filed signatures for a veto referendum to preclude the use of RCV for the 2020 election, but Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap found there were insufficient valid signatures to qualify for the ballot. A challenge in Maine Superior Court was successful for the Maine Republican Party, but the Maine Supreme Judicial Court [ 24 ] [ 25 ] stayed the ruling pending appeal on September 8, 2020. [ 26 ] Nevertheless, ballots began being printed later that day without the veto referendum and including RCV for the presidential election, [ 27 ] [ 28 ] and the Court ruled in favor of the secretary of state on September 22, allowing RCV to be used.

As a nation, we now find ourselves at a different point in the pandemic \u2013 with more tools and resources than ever before to better protect ourselves and our communities. CDC has been working for many months to fold the agency\u2019s COVID-19 emergency response activities into its existing structure and programs, as part of an ongoing transition to sustainable public health practice. The agency has also been working with partners, including states and local territories, to prepare for the end of the PHE declaration and communicate updated reporting requirements and cadences. While reporting frequency and source data for some metrics will shift when the PHE declaration ends, CDC will continue to report valuable data to inform individual and\nin certain countries. In October 2021, the White House announced that, starting November 8, 2021, the U.S. government would move away from the country-by-country restrictions previously applied during the COVID-19 pandemic and adopt travel policies that rely primarily on vaccination to advance the safe resumption of travel.

There is no indication that ID2020 was ever canceled or that Trump had any direct involvement in its status.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the knowledge does not support the claim that Trump canceled ID2020 and instead suggests that the project continues to exist without any mention of cancellation, we can conclude that the statement is false.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"False\"\n}\n```", "answer": "False"}, "searches": {"google_searches": [{"query": "[RAG Database]", "result": "control over their \u201cdigital IDs.\u201d For example, it has partnered with iRespond and the International Rescue Committee on a program to \u201coffer a digital identity platform\u201d to refugees at a camp in Thailand that would allow them \u201cto not only access improved healthcare services but also securely store educational and professional credentials.\u201d The organization was founded by several partners \u2014 including Microsoft, of which Gates is co-founder, and by Gavi , a Gates-backed organization that seeks to provide access to vaccines in impoverished countries. In recent months, ID2020 has been the subject of conspiracy theories. We\u2019ve previously written about a false claim that Gates has proposed tracking people with microchips. Some have evidently linked such baseless claims also to ID2020. As Snopes reports , those claims misrepresent ID2020\u2019s projects. The notion that a Gates project was \u201ccancelled\u201d may be a reference to an at-home testing initiative for the novel coronavirus, backed by Gates, that was taking place in the Seattle area. The Food and Drug Administration recently ordered the project to temporarily halt its effort until additional approvals were granted; but it hasn\u2019t been permanently canceled. That project \u2014 the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network \u2014 wrote on its website on May 14 that \u201c SCAN\u2019s test is authorized by the Washington State Department of Health. However, the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) recently clarified its guidance for home-based, self-collected samples to test for COVID-19.\u201d \u201cWe have been notified that a separate federal emergency use authorization (EUA) is required to return results for self-collected tests,\u201d the statement says. \u201cThe FDA has not raised any concerns regarding the safety and accuracy of SCAN\u2019s test, but we have been asked to pause testing until we receive that additional authorization.\u201d Claim: Trump \u201cwill not allow vaccines to be mandatory.\u201d There\u2019s no evidence Trump has taken any recent action to mandate, or bar the mandate of, vaccines. Right now, there are some vaccine mandates under state laws, as we\u2019ll explain. This claim might be a reference to a statement Trump made on May 15 while discussing \u201c Operation Warp Speed \u201d \u2014 a federal initiative to quickly find a vaccine and treatments for COVID-19. \u201cW e\u2019re looking for a full vaccine for everyone that wants to get it,\u201d Trump said while answering a reporter\u2019s question. \u201cNot everybody is going to want to get it.\u201d Trump has in the past, and recently, expressed reticence toward the\nThis bill authorizes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to award grants for testing, contact tracing, monitoring, and other activities to ...\nThe bill says nothing about forced testing, forced entry to people's houses or the removal of family members to be quarantined.\nwhich described the federal government\u2019s stance on \u201cresponsible\u201d deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI), including in the health care space. Pursuant to that order, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was tasked with establishing an AI task force and developing a strategic plan, which they released at the beginning of January. President Biden\u2019s order, according to the Trump administration, \u201cestablished unnecessarily burdensome requirements for companies developing and deploying AI that would stifle private sector innovation and threaten American technological leadership.\u201d President Trump has named a new Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, and has called for the development of an AI action plan within 180 days. President Trump signed a new order titled \u201cRemoving Barriers to American AI Innovation,\u201d which claims the Biden-era order hindered innovation and placed \u201cunnecessary government control over the development of AI.\u201d It also states that \u201cAmerican development of AI systems must be free from ideological bias or engineered social agendas. President Trump has publicly announced support for the $500B \u201cStargate Initiative,\u201d which is meant to fuel AI adoption in healthcare, manufacturing, and defense through private funding. The leaders of the AI companies funding this initiative have highlighted AI\u2019s ability to transform health care, including using AI to rapidly develop new vaccines. While the new administration\u2019s support for innovation in AI is apparent, the direction for the regulation and oversight of AI in health care is murkier than ever before. 4. World Health Organization . President Trump issued an Order requiring the United States to leave the World Health Organization (WHO), which is consistent with his 2020 push for the United States\u2019 exit that former President Biden blocked shortly after he was inaugurated in 2021. President Trump cites in the Order the \u201cmishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic\u201d and the WHO\u2019s \u201cinability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence\u201d of other member states. He also stated that the WHO demands unfair payments from the U.S., the top donor to the WHO, when compared to the other member countries. For example, China contributes 90% less to the WHO than the U.S. despite having a larger population. 5. Gender Affirming Care . The Trump administration has issued an order titled \u201cDefending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,\u201d which essentially removes the concept of gender identity from federal government policies and procedures, including removing health care afforded to people\nhelping more Puerto Ricans on a faster timeline. In September 2025, the Energy Department cancelled more than $13 billion in unobligated funds that were appropriated to advance the previous administration\u2019s wasteful Green New Scam agenda and returned these funds to the U.S. Treasury. FACT SHEET: Trump Administration Outlines Plan To Build Big Power Plants Again ENDING THE WAR ON BEAUTIFUL, CLEAN COAL While the last administration declared war on American coal, President Trump and DOE are fully committed to strengthening American coal-workers and coal's critical role in powering America. Thanks to President Trump, wages for coal workers are up and coal plants across the country are reversing plans to shut down. At the end of 2025, more than 17 gigawatts of coal-powered electricity generation will have been saved, strengthening grid reliability and affordability. To date, the Energy Department has prevented the closure of five reliable coal plants. Following the President\u2019s Executive Order to \u201cReinvigorate America\u2019s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry,\u201d Secretary Wright issued five initiatives to expand and modernize the coal industry and support emerging technologies. The Energy Department reinstated the National Coal Council to provide expert guidance on the future of coal technologies and markets. On January 15, 2026, the NCC held its inaugural meeting and appointed council leadership, including Jim Grech of Peabody Energy Corp. who was named as Committee Chair and Jimmy Brock of Core Natural Resources, as Vice Chair.

Thanks to President Trump, the next American Nuclear Renaissance has arrived. DOE has taken numerous actions to accelerate the development of next generation nuclear technology and restore domestic supply chains to accomplish President Trump\u2019s goal of expanding American nuclear energy capacity from approximately 100 GW in 2024 to 400 GW by 2050. In December 2025, the Energy Department awarded $800 million to TVA and Holtec to advance deployment of U.S. small modular reactors. In January 2026 , the Energy Department announced a $2.7 billion investment to strengthen domestic enrichment, in support of President Trump\u2019s commitment to expand U.S. capacity for low-enriched uranium (LEU) and jumpstart new supply chains and innovations for high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU).

While most people would be retired by her age, the 85-year-old feminist pioneer is committed to spending at least another five years on the bench. How does she do it? In part by maintaining a challenging fitness regimen . If you\u2019ve tuned into CNN Film's \"RBG\" documentary featuring the two-time cancer survivor in her \u201csuper diva\u201d sweatshirt working out with her longtime personal trainer Bryant Johnson , or checked out Johnson\u2019s new book, \u201c The RBG Workout: How She Stays Strong\u2026And You Can, Too \u201d, then you know these exercises aren\u2019t for the faint of motivation.

Regaining strength after chemotherapy Though Ginsburg looks like she\u2019s been kicking gym butt all her life in that CNN promo, she wasn\u2019t always in such killer shape. In fact, when she first consulted with Johnson in 1999, after finishing chemotherapy for colon cancer, she was far from feeling her best. \u201cShe was very [drained] after the chemotherapy, and she and her husband felt she had to start focusing on her strength,\u201d Johnson, who also serves as an expert on The Vitamin Shoppe Wellness Council and has been a member of the U.S army for over 30 years, tells NBC News BETTER. \u201cI was recommended to her by another judge I\u2019d been training after she reached out to him. I talked\ncounter \u201cRuth Bader Ginsberg has workout book.\u201d It seemed important news for everyone but also was my way of saying \u201cHelp me.\u201d One half of the counter duo looked stricken and said \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look so fit.\u201d I slapped him across the face. \u201cShe\u2019s 84 years-old,\u201d I retorted. \u201cDo you expect her to look like Gal Gadot? You better Gal Get out of here.\u201d The counter man prattled on, arguing only with himself now. \u201cWell, she was an athlete when she was young. They say that the key to a long life is physical fitness when you\u2019re young. So, I can see it.\u201d While this may be true, I\u2019m 36 years-old and have avoided breaking a non-panic attack sweat for my whole life so I probably only have a couple years left. Wasting time arguing with this nincompoop didn't seem like a good use of my sunset years. I sentenced the man behind the counter to house arrest and proceeded to purchase the book.

There was absolutely nothing to be mad at in this unassuming, friendly workout book. The warm-ups take about 15 pages, or 10 minutes. They consist of simple stretches and a walk on a treadmill. Next comes strength exercises. This takes up the bulk of the workout. Using free weights, resistance bands, medicine balls, Swiss balls and sometimes household objects like chairs and ottomans, Johnson focuses on different muscle groups with exercises usually in sets of three. Finally, you cool down with another round of stretches. While it's all recommended, none of it is required and Johnson offers a number of slightly less intense iterations. \"If you reach a point where you feel like you just caught a ride on the struggle bus... I hereby order you to recuse yourself from the rest of the workout,\" Bryant writes. The RBG Workout is filled with accessible instructions and short pep talks like this. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with setting specific goals,\u201d Bryant writes in one pep talk, \u201cbut the most important outcome of an exercise can\u2019t be quantified.

The NPR correspondent Nina Totenberg , a reporter covering Supreme Court who published the original report about Justice Ginsburg's last wish, subsequently confirmed that the statement had come from Ginsburg herself. Totenberg stated that there were other witnesses in the room, apart from her granddaughter, including her doctor. [ 49 ] Trump's allegation gave birth to a conspiracy theory which spread quickly through social media and was taken up by some conservative public figures. Fox News host Tucker Carlson declared that it would have been \"pathetic\" for Justice Ginsburg to make such a dying declaration and that he did not believe she had said it. [ 50 ] Subsequently, Senator Ted Cruz , Republican from Texas , blocked the U.S. Senate resolution honoring Ginsburg because it contained language referring to her dying wish. [ 51 ] International [ edit ] Ursula von der Leyen , President of the European Commission , described Ginsburg as a \"pioneer for women's right, law and justice\". [ 52 ] Justin Trudeau , Prime Minister of Canada , wrote: \"A profound and fearless advocate for women, equality, and justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg's impact will undoubtedly be felt for generations. My thoughts are with her family, colleagues, and all who were inspired by her lifetime of service.\" [ 53 ] Emmanuel Macron , President of France , wrote: \"A truly exceptional woman has left us. Throughout her entire life, Ruth Bader Ginsburg fought for justice, gender equality,\nall of us. If confirmed, I would not assume that role for the sake of those in my own circle and certainly not for my own sake. I would assume this role to serve you. I would discharge the judicial oath, which requires me to administer justice without respect to persons, do equal right to the poor and rich, and faithfully and impartially discharge my duties under the United States Constitution.\" Death Of Ruth Bader Ginsburg VIDEO: Mourners Reflect On Ginsburg's Life And Legacy Trump appointed Barrett to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago just three years ago. Before that, she taught law at the University of Notre Dame for 15 years and had clerked for Scalia, widely seen by conservatives as a legal legend. Barrett is admired by conservatives for her positions on abortion rights and the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. A devout Catholic, she is also a favorite of religious conservatives. At 48, Barrett would be the youngest justice on the Supreme Court if confirmed, allowing her to potentially shape American law and society for generations. Within hours of Ginsburg's death last Friday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., pledged to bring Trump's nominee for a vote on the Senate floor. The president has made clear he wants his nominee approved by Election Day, predicting that the results of the presidential election may end up in front of the Supreme Court . Democrats, including presidential nominee Joe Biden, say whoever wins in November should pick the next justice, citing McConnell's successful effort in 2016 to block President Barack Obama's nominee for the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland , about eight months before the election. Now, Trump is setting up a Supreme Court fight just over a month before the 2020 election. While Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have said they do not support a vote on a nominee before the election, other Republican senators considered to be potential swing votes, including Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah , announced they would support moving forward with a Supreme Court confirmation.

This is a very specific assertion that would require direct evidence from Biden's speeches or public statements.\n\n3. **Public Statements on Transgender Rights**: While Biden has made statements supporting transgender rights, including the rights of parents to support their children in their gender identity, there is no widely recognized or documented instance where he explicitly stated that an 8-year-old child has an unequivocal right to transition. Discussions around children transitioning often involve considerations of medical, psychological, and social factors, and Biden's public statements typically reflect a nuanced understanding of these issues.\n\n4. **Fact-Checking Resources**: Fact-checking organizations have scrutinized claims about Biden's views on transgender issues.

President Biden has defended his son on multiple occasions, including in a feisty presidential debate with Mr Trump in 2020. Ahead of the trial, he released a statement: \"I am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today.\" But he has said that, if a jury convicts Hunter Biden in this trial or the next, he should not expect to be pardoned. Mixing family and business Getty Images Hunter laughs with Joe Biden and Barack Obama in 2010 After graduating from Yale, Hunter worked at MBNA America, a bank holding company headquartered in Delaware and later acquired by Bank of America. Joe Biden's close ties to the bank - one of the largest employers in Delaware and a top contributor to his political campaigns - earned him the unfavourable moniker of \"the senator from MBNA\". As Hunter was promoted to the rank of executive vice-president, Joe pushed bankruptcy reform legislation favourable to MBNA through the Senate. In the early 2000s, while still receiving consulting fees from the bank, Hunter opened a Washington lobbying practice. It saw him land \"clients with interests that overlapped with [his father's] committee assignments and legislative priorities\", according to Politico Magazine. The father-son relationship at the time, he told the New Yorker, was that neither would speak to the other about lobbying work. President Biden has maintained this to be true in the case of more recent allegations of wrongdoing as well.
